<p>Hello Everyone,</p>
<p>Unfortunately we broke paper.dash.org on January 4th and the seeding process for generating a wallet was insecure since then. There are no known Dash thefts that have taken place because of this (yet), but if you created a wallet using paper.dash.org between January 4th and April 5th, please move your money to a new place.</p>
<p>We take these kinds of issues quite seriously and believe it's our fiduciary responsibility to create the most secure environment for users to store value safely in our ecosystem. To address the issue weâ€™ve reverted the patch that caused the issue and have also reverted paper.dash.org to an earlier, much safer version.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Evan Duffield</p>
