<p>We are now less than a week away from having a final network budget for the July payment cycle. I have outlined this month’s funding requests for the core team and community sponsored proposals as they stand right now. The next superblock is scheduled for block 498480, which should occur at approximately 11am (UTC) on Wednesday, July 6th.</p>
<p>If you have not already reviewed and voted on the proposals submitted throughout the month, there is still time to vote. Remember that votes must be submitted by the time the budgets finalize 24 hours before the payment cycle, so make sure to vote no later than ~10am UTC on July 5th.</p>
<p><b>V12.1 reminder</b></p>
<p>12.1 is now in testing. When 12.1 is released, the budget system will be “reset” and we will add each budget proposal back manually. For this reason, all budget items are single month proposals until the new system is operational on mainnet.</p>
<p>Complete Budget (as of current voting rank):</p>
