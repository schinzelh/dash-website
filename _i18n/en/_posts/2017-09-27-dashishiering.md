I'm Spencer, the new global recruiter working on Dash's technical roles, and I wanted to introduce myself to the community and remind everyone that the Dash Team is hiring engineers!

I have job descriptions available and will be creating public posts shortly, but please message me if you would like more details immediately.

If you are not looking for a job but would like to help anyway, please add me on LinkedIn at the link below and share my job posts from time to time. A few extra likes and comments can really go a long way to helping the message reach a new audience. My network is weakest in Europe so if you have a strong network there, please get connected! https://www.linkedin.com/in/spencer007/ .

I am looking forward to helping Dash find some amazing developers to ensure this project remains one of the best cryptocurrencies in the world!


Please get in touch on reddit or on LinkedIn with any questions about the jobs or anything Dash related and I'll do my best to get back to you in a timely manner. .

Thanks!
-Spencer
