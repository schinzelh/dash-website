<p>Exodus, in conjunction with the Dash core development team, is pleased to announce Dash support inside the latest Exodus early preview available today.</p>
<p>Exodus brings a friendly experience to decentralized tokens like Bitcoin, Dash, Ethereum and more. Adding Dash support furthers the Exodus foundation of a decentralized multi­asset experience to secure, exchange and manage wealth inside one beautiful application.</p>
<p>Exodus keeps all keys and transaction data locally for your eyes only ­ no accounts, no servers, no data sharing. In addition to a focus on privacy Exodus supports the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>●  1­click exchanges between Dash and other assets. Exodus is the first desktop multi­asset wallet with ShapeShift built in.</li>
<li>●  No more messy copy/paste exchanges between wallets. Exodus is the only way to exchange Ethereum for Dash inside one application.</li>
<li>●  Exodus wraps solid engineering inside beautiful design. From pixel­perfect icons to subtle sounds, Exodus is a multi­asset experience that "just works for normal people".</li>
<li>●  Track the value of your multi­asset portfolio, in real time, as market conditions change. Quote from Evan Duffield, Dash lead developer:“Exodus is a wonderfully simple, easy to use and beautiful cryptocurrency wallet. It's exactly what’s needed in the space right now and we’re really happy to be a part of it.”
<p>Exodus early previews are released biweekly on Fridays. Enter your email to download the latest version with Dash support at<br />
