Dash has partnered with ePaymints, a global merchant account and payments processing solutions provider, “to accelerate adoption of Dash cryptocurrency in high chargeback and cash based industries”.

Bradley Zastrow, Global Head of Business Development at Dash Core Group, highlighted in the press release how the partnership will expand Dash’s market reach to those that desperately need payment solutions.

“Cash based and high chargeback industries pay much higher credit card fees on average, and that’s when they are lucky enough to get credit card acceptance – often that’s not an option. This is an obvious use case for Dash, and we’re proud to be recognized by ePaymints as the leading cryptocurrency positioned to solve these payment problems. Already, there are client integration consultations under way and together, we look forward to expanding the Dash ecosystem.”
