Dash Price Support

In the last analysis, I mentioned that Dash price may soon break the $100 handle once again. It not only broke the stated level, but also managed to clear the last high of $102.35. It created a new high above $110 and traded as high as $118.16. The most important point is the fact that the price remained supported above $80. There was a move towards the 38.2% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $48 low to $102.35 high where it found support.

Moreover, I highlighted a bullish trend line in the last analysis on the 4-hours chart of DASH/USD (data feed from Poloniex) with support at $90. It kind of played well, and helped the price remain above $80. It is currently intact with support at $95. If the price dips from the current levels, then the trend line support might play well above $90. It also coincides with the 38.2% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $65 low to $118.16 high.

So, if the price moves down, it might find support near $95 and $90. On the upside, there is a resistance trend line near $120. It may stop the current upside for now before buyers step up the momentum.
