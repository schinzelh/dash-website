PKO Bank Polski has fully implemented the blockchain-based solution and starts shipping new product regulations in digital form to over 5 million customers. In terms of scale, it is the largest in Europe application of blockchain technology in banking, the bank said.

And it runs on Dash blockchain.

How it works?

In electronic correspondence from the bank, customers will find, among others, 64-character unique hash identifier of the document and link to the bankâ€™s website, where without logging in, simply after pasting the hash identifier (this hash is stored in our blockchain) or after uploading the previously downloaded document will receive information whether the document is authentic and the last time it was modified. Thanks to such a solution, clients will keep access to documents even after the cooperation with the bank has ended and they will be sure that they have not been modified.
