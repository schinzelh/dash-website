Dash Core 0.12.3.3 is a critical bugfix release of the Dash Core 0.12.3.x series.

There was a serious vulnerability discovered in Bitcoin Core's codebase recently which
can cause node receiving a specially crafted block to crash [https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14247](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14247)


We encourage all full node operators (masternodes, mining pools, explorers, exchanges etc.) to update ASAP.

Full release notes are available at [https://github.com/dashpay/dash/blob/v0.12.3.3/doc/release-notes.md](https://github.com/dashpay/dash/blob/v0.12.3.3/doc/release-notes.md),
