<p>Retail forex broker FXOpen is again showing its commitment to cryprocurrency traders by launching Dash-based pairs and being the first ever in the market to do so. The firm announced that it is now offering DSH/BTC as well as ETH/RUB (ether/Russian ruble) for both its demo and live crypto users.</p>
<p>We expected this move by FXOpen last month when the brokerage first added Ethereum support with ETH/USD and ETH/BTC pairs. This was done not long after <a href="http://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/trading/btc-e-adds-ethereum-dash-bitcoin-trading-pairs/">BTC-e revealed that it had successfully completed the addition of two new trading pairs</a> based on Ethereum and Dash. At the time we predicted that this move by BTC-e might help Ethereum and Dash become more popular with active retail MT4 traders, especially in Russia and China.</p>
<p>Natalia Zakharova, Head of Global Sales at FXOpen, commented to Finance Magnates: “After we introduced ETC/BTC and ETC/USD in May 2016 we received a lot of positive feedback from our clients and significant interest in ETC liquidity. So the next logical step is to anticipate our clients future needs and introduce dashcoin, which is a hot new instrument right now.”</p>
<p>Dash, the cryptocurrency formerly known as DarkCoin, marked its second birthday back in January with a vote among its stakeholders to increase the blocksize from 1 MB to 2 MB. <a href="http://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/interview-2/dash-founder-cryptocurrency-world-needs-more-capacity-than-just-bitcoin/" target="_blank">Evan Duffield, creator and chief architect of Dash</a>, shared his thoughts with Finance Magnates about this move and his creation at the time.</p>
