DASH, the fastest growing cryptocurrency has expanded its footprint by getting listed on the leading Russian cryptocurrency exchange service, MaRSe. With this inclusion, the offline cryptocurrency exchange now supports both Bitcoin and DASH.

The third largest cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalization, DASH announced its partnership with MaRSe and another European exchange [BitPanda](https://www.bitpanda.com/) in its recent press release. Following few recent technological breakthroughs and expansion initiatives, the cryptocurrency has gained traction across the community. It has resulted in an eight-fold increase in the price since the beginning of 2017 — rising from $11.21 to $90.40.

The platform’s partnerships make DASH even more easily accessible, further driving adoption and trade volumes. The Vice President of Business Development at DASH Daniel Diaz was quoted in the press release saying,

“We are very excited about Dash being added to BitPanda and to MaRSe. We are focused on improving access to Dash for users across the planet and it’s exciting to see spikes in demand from places like Europe and Russia. Firstly, BitPanda is the type of high quality broker we need on the Dash ecosystem; they offer multiple payment options as well as Bitcoin and Ethereum integration so it’s huge news for European users. Secondly, MaRSe is the largest and most reputable Russian exchange for bitcoin and now Dash, so we expect trading volumes to increase.”
The European BitPanda exchange formerly known as Coinimal has a broad reach and offers a range of payment options for its users. The platform has included DASH following an increased demand for the cryptocurrency among its user base, allowing them to make an instant purchase by paying with VISA/MasterCard powered credit cards, Sofort, SEPA, Neteller, Skrill or EPS/GiroPay. Meanwhile, those in Moscow can now walk into MaRSe outlet and trade DASH for Rubles or vice versa.

The year so far has been eventful for DASH, as it has entered into lots of strategic partnerships with leading cryptocurrency platforms like [Bitfinex](http://www.newsbtc.com/2017/03/04/dash-makes-available-bitfinex-exchange-platform/), [BlockPay](http://www.newsbtc.com/2017/02/24/dash-partners-blockpay-enables-pos-payments-physical-stores/), [Bitsane](http://www.newsbtc.com/2017/02/07/bitsane-exchange-platform-now-supports-advcash-dash-and-iconomi-transactions/) and more.

The latest [Sentinel upgrade](http://www.newsbtc.com/2017/02/06/dash-sentinel-upgrade-payments/), paving the way for the upcoming Project Evolution that aims to present DASH as a go-to cryptocurrency payments system has pushed the cryptocurrency to the limelight. If the current pace of development is any indication, then DASH stands to make a lot of progress in the coming months, eventually commanding a much stronger position in the crypto-market.
