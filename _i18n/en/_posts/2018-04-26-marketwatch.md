Mainstream media powerhouse MarketWatch just added prices for eight more cryptocurrencies to its roster.

The company is now tracking Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Litecoin (LTC), Ethereum Classic (ETC), Monero (XMR), Dash (DASH) and Zcash (ZEC).

MarketWatch is using data feeds from cryptocurrency exchange Kraken to list quotes in real time, along with historical price trends. Users will be able to see prices in the US dollar and the euro.

"Though interest may wax and wane (along with prices), we feel that no matter what happens to any particular cryptocurrency, no matter how much our hash rates --- and heart rates --- may increase, the most exciting stories in this space are still yet to be told."\

MarketWatch is one of the biggest websites on the globe, currently ranked at number 974 worldwide and 301 in the US, according to Alexa Internet, Inc.

The site first added real-time prices for Bitcoin (BTC) about a year ago. Since then, the company says readers spent a total of 1.1 million minutes staring at the price of Bitcoin.
