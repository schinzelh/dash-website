Crypto currencies are going through extreme volatility. What will it take for them to be accepted for regular use?

To find out about that I spoke with the Director of Business Development for Dash Core, Brad Zastrow. Dash is Digital Cash and a widely popular cryptocurrency. In this video he talked about where cryptocurrencies are being embraced widely (this might surprise you!) and how adoption will take place.

He also shared about a way you can earn cryptocurrency, particularly Dash, by buying merchandise from over 7,000 merchants and earn Dash as a reward. This is worth seeing the video just for itself.

Enjoy this and please share this with others. If you haven't already, please subscribe so you can keep up to date on new developments with blockchain, bitcoin, and other digital currencies.

I look forward to hearing from you!
