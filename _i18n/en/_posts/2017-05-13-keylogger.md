A keylogger file has been detected in several HP laptops, meaning that sensitive information, including private keys or passwords to Dash wallets, could be compromised.

An audio driver on several HP laptops, Conexant HD audio driver, has been found to contain a keylogger, which detects user keystrokes and stores them in a log file. Malware that has access to user’s private documents would therefore also be able to acquire access to all keystrokes performed on the machine. Swiss security firm Modzero detected the keylogger activity and published these findings. Since then, a patch has been issued by HP that removes both the keylogger and log files, however it is unclear how much private data has been compromised so far.

Keyloggers can take your private keys

These security vulnerabilities found on HP laptops can prove dangerous to cryptocurrency wallets, and Dash users should take care to maintain the security of their funds online to prevent thefts. If a wallet’s private keys are acquired, that allows that party complete access to the wallet’s funds, including moving them. This includes several-word “seeds” for hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallets.

A keylogger can track keystrokes, including when entering passwords, PINs, and a manually typed-out private keys and wallet seeds. Malware can also log clipboard contents, meaning that a generated private key or wallet seed that has been copied and pasted to be stored elsewhere can be intercepted by a thief.

It’s important to store your Dash securely

Since Dash is a distributed peer-to-peer digital cash and is itself not controlled by any third party, the user is responsible for the security of their funds. As a precautionary measure, passwords and PINs should never be stored on the device, or copied and pasted. The same applies for private keys, except private keys should not even be typed out, but rather written down by hand and stored in a secure location.

As a general rule, mobile and web wallets should be thought of as pocket change and not be used to store significant amounts of Dash. The most secure way to store funds would be in cold storage, or at a location not accessible via the internet, such as a paper wallet or hardware wallet. Currently, trusted hardware wallets Ledger and Trezor support Dash, giving an easy solution to secure funds.
