<p>In the afttermath of the recent Moolah/Mintpal bankruptcy case, the altcoin community has ramped up their search for secure and stable exchanges. Whilst some standard exchanges continue to function adequately, an all too often overlooked alternative is <a href="https://cex.io/">CEX.IO</a>. <a href="https://cex.io/">CEX.IO</a> acts not just as a cloud mining provider (as many associate it with), but also as an exchange. It includes a number of useful trading pairs, including Dollars/Euros. Also, of special interest to the altcoin community, is the fact that is has firmly adopted Dash. <a href="https://cex.io/">CEX.IO</a> was an early believer in Dash. Now, after extensive testing, <a href="https://cex.io/">CEX.IO</a> is now challenging the traditional exchanges by offering Dash. This event follows a general pattern of Dash adoption in the cryptocurrency economy.</p>
<p>What does this mean? Now, Dash and all supported cryptocurrency users are able to migrate their cloud mining operations to the same site as they conduct their trading, thereby making the entire process seamless. Both mining and trading are streamlined through a beautiful interface. For Dash traders <a href="https://cex.io/">CEX.IO</a> offers a strong alternative, opening up new opportunities such as trading Dash to fiat alongside their Dash mining operations. Debate concerning where to reliably trade Dash might finally be answered thanks for the faith <a href="https://cex.io/">CEX.IO</a> has shown in Dash.</p>
<p><a href="https://cex.io/">CEX.IO</a> is a London-based Bitcoin crypto exchange and the first cloud mining service. As an exchange, <a href="https://cex.io/">CEX.IO</a> has a wide variety of trading pairs, including fiat money (USD and EUR), cryptocurrencies and mining commodities (GHS or Bitcoin cloud mining power). <a href="https://cex.io/">CEX.IO</a> works in conjunction with the largest Bitcoin mining pool â€” GHash.IO, and is trusted by over 300,000 users from all over the world.</p>
