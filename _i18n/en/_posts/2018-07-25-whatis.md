Hello Dash Community,

In the spirit of radical transparency: area updates from our bi-weekly management meetings. In this way, you can follow the evolution of our organization and decision-making, as well as our product development. We hope you use this information to hold us accountable to our plans, learn with us, and contribute to growth of the Dash decentralized autonomous organization.

Yes - we know you hate the PDF; we do, too. Expect changes to what and how we report after next quarterly.
