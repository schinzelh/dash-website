According to reports out today, local authorities in Queensland are alleged to be piloting a programme that could see the adoption of a number of [cryptocurrencies](https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2018/07/market-update-eos-xlm-and-ada-take-a-big-plunge/) within the state. The currencies in question include [Bitcoin](https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2018/07/mining-takes-a-turd-for-the-worse-you-can-now-mine-crypto-with-your-poop/), Litecoin, Ethereum, Dash and NEM.

The project is set to see the government approve work by a company called TravelbyBit, an established [cryptocurrency](https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2018/07/google-sends-warning-to-cryptocurrency-mining-apps/) project that allows merchants to accept cryptocurrency payments.

According to [Bitcoinist.com](http://bitcoinist.com/), Kate Jones, Queensland's Minister for Innovation and Tourism Industry Development has said:

In essence, this will allow merchants in Queensland to see a roll out of cryptocurrency adoption, which in turn promises to bring new customers to a range of shops on the premise that they are able to spend a range of different cryptocurrencies in there.

It's a project that the CEO of TravelbyBit, Caleb Yeoh is excited about:
