Privacy-focused altcoin Dash has announced a [three-year roadmap](https://www.dash.org/2017/06/27/roadmap.html) for its Evolution “decentralized payments platform.”

In a press release Tuesday, Dash, in a long-awaited announcement as to its future plans, confirmed the platform would be live in Alpha mode by December.

“Think of Evolution as online payments, a system similar to PayPal or Venmo, but completely decentralized, so that a user is always in control of his or her own money,” Dash Core CEO Ryan Taylor explained.

“Moreover, Evolution will be incredibly inexpensive, with no cross-border fees or restrictions.”

Dash’s aim is to create a universal payments mechanism involving physical merchants, online point-of-sale and user-to-user transfers.

The project has seen huge investment, buoyed by the continued high trading price of the DASH token since the start of the year.

“Evolution is a massive endeavor with gigantic promises, but we will accomplish our goals through the help of an All-Star team of dozens of the world’s best programmers, researchers, project managers, technologists and user experience experts,” Taylor added.

With the full release slated for June 2018 meanwhile, further milestones on the horizon include hardware integrations to scale up the size of the Dash network drastically.
