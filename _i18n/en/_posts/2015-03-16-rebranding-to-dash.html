<p>Darkcoin is changing its name/branding to Dash - Digital Cash. The new name will start being used officially and in external services from March 25th onwards.</p>
<p>Dash’s vision has always been to create a trustless, decentralised, private and fast payment platform for the benefit of the majority. We are happy with the progress we are making towards reaching this goal. We’ve been able to release instant transaction confirmations, refine our privacy technology and develop our Masternode network into a strong and truly decentralised platform. We’re building a complete solution and working hard to make crypto more suitable for real world adoption. This is why we believe our new brand Dash will better represent all aspects of our platform and make it more accessible to end users.</p>
<p>We are only changing the name, no technology is affected by this. The coin, the blockchain and the people will be the same. Users don’t need to act on this, the next update of the wallet will have the new brand and it will be a standard update.</p>
<p>A new logo design has been commissioned and it will be made available after the Dash Foundation members vote in around a week's time. Exchanges, payment processors and other services have been notified so they can prepare in advance.</p>
<p>Our ideals remain intact and we will continue to pursue them under any branding we have, now and in the future.<br />
