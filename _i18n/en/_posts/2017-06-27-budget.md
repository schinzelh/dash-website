As of today, all Dash Core Team proposals have been submitted to the network. Once again, due to the continued price increase compared with last month, we do not require additional funding for office space, marketing, infrastructure, applications, business development, public relations, HR, or legal. For the first time, we will also not be requesting funding for compensation of the team. For all of these areas / functions, we have sufficient funding to operate from existing balances and price appreciation.

As with last month, the absence of these budgets is not a sign that the core team intends to discontinue any of these expenses. It is simply that the balances we normally keep in these categories to protect against currency fluctuations has risen in value dramatically and we can rely on savings to fulfill our obligations, even after taking currency fluctuation risks into account.

We are requesting funding for several one-time items, including packages at two conferences scheduled for October, and a research grant to fund Dash-specific research through Arizona State University's new Blockchain Research Laboratory.

There are some forthcoming plans and communications concerning an expanded marketing effort. Look for that communication within the next couple of days.
