New version 0.5.2 is released: <https://bisq.io/downloads36>

This release removes the requirement for exchanging the email address and to do an ID check with the trading peer when using payment methods with bank transfer. 
See the discussion at that forum post for more background.

Beside that we added an in-app downloader and signature check, so the next release you can download from the application and you can be sure that the signature matches.
