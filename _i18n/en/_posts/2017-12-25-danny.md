(15 min onwards - all about Dash and Crypto with Danny)

Stephen and Max travel to Corpus Cristi to attend the “Best of the Best Southwest” conference where Stephen was invited to be a guest speaker and to meet local business owners to talk about the local economy and see how they’re dealing with the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey.  Then they sit down to talk with Danny who works in crypto-currency and helped the local hurricane victims escape the flooding.
