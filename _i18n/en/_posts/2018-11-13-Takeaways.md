Every quarter, the Dash Core team releases a quarterly conference call to inform the community and masternodes of progress and field a few questions. These calls are often hours long, however, and not everyone has the time or attention span to glean all relevant information from the call. In the interest of helping the community get the relevant information, I have listened to the call and included the most important developments/announcements that I noticed.

The call is linked below, along with my four key takewaways:

1: New Intermediary Version 0.14 Introduced, Added to Roadmap

Probably the biggest, and least touted, announcement from the call is the introduction of a new Dash version between version 0.13 and 1.0â€™s main Evolution release: 0.14. This intermediary version will mainly include the introduction of long-living masternode quorums (LLMQs). This addition was originally intended for the 0.13 release, however due to the complexity and significance of this improvement it could not be included without delaying the rest of the release a whole additional month. As such, 0.13 is now released for testnet, while, 0.14 will likely follow next month.

In addition to the addition of the new version, Core released a roadmap of sorts for versions up to 1.0, outlining the parallel developments of three key elements: DashPay, Platform, and Core. The Core element includes the base protocol for Dash, while Platform includes background and supporting structure, and DashPay encompasses the most consumer-facing elements for the most publicly visible parts of Evolution. Of these three, only Core includes releases before version 1.0, at which point all three sync up.
