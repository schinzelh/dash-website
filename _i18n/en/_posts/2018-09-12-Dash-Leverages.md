Dash has [announced](https://blog.dash.org/introducing-long-living-masternode-quorums-76ea8b23a85a) the introduction of Long Living Masternode Quorums (LLMQs), which is currently under development and will influence both Evolution and non-Evolution features of Dash.

Alexander Block, a Dash Core Group developer, started off by recalling his last blog post about quorums and how despite their revolutionary offerings, they do not scale very well. Whereas LLMQs “only increase the required resources (CPU, RAM, network) on the members of such quorums, instead of increasing the load on the whole network”. Also different from regular quorums, LLMQs are built beforehand and reused for a fixed period of time rather than created on demand.
