We are pleased to announce the release of Dash version 12.3, which improves InstantSend and lays additional foundation for Dash Evolution. The upgrade is complete, tested, and ready for release. Although ready now, as with past releases we feel it is prudent to wait until after the next superblock to officially release. EDIT: Version 12.3 will be generally available after the next superblock which occurs around 13:00 UTC on July 3, 2018.

We encourage all masternode operators, exchanges, pools and explorers to update to version 12.3, as the upgrade will be required in order to continue receiving rewards. For masternode operators, the upgrade will require a restart.

The upgrade will include a new devnets feature to enable the creation of multiple independent devnets. Each devnet is identified by a name which is hardened into a “devnet genesis” block and is automatically positioned at height 1 block. This upgrade will also lower the number of inputs designated to each wallet, improve user privacy by eliminating the merging together of small non-private inputs, and decrease UTXO set size.
