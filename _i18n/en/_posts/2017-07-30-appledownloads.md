While other cryptocurrency prices have been slipping, Dash picked up steam with the recent announcement of its Apple-approved status.

After a long, complex back and forth with the technology giant, Dash Core has succeeded in demonstrating to the Apple App Store team the value, and stability, of their wallet app as well as the viability of Dash the cryptocurrency.

To date, the App Store has only approved 10 cryptocurrencies including Dash, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Lisk, Steem, Litecoin, and Ripple.

A Strong Product to Inspire Confidence

The Dash Core team has been hard at work building a robust, stable mobile platform for holders and users of the cryptocurrency.

The issuance of an official wallet application inspires in users “confidence that the software is robust and will be maintained and improved going forward,” in the words of Dash Core CEO Ryan Taylor.

The official wallet will also, unlike multi-coin wallets, support the myriad of Dash-specific features, like InstantSend, that make Dash a favorite among many cryptocurrency enthusiasts.

Worth the Effort

Over the course of nearly two years, the Dash Core team compiled documentation and prepared appeal after appeal to demonstrate why it’s product and currency were deserving of being approved.

While it seemed bleak at times, with Apple releasing a list of approved currencies in 2016 which included The DAO (post-collapse) yet excluded Dash (a top 10 digital currency for over two years at that point), the final approval for the Dash wallet has been met with widespread enthusiasm.

Speaking to CCN, Taylor reports:

In the first two days, we had nearly 2,000 downloads… the first reviews are all coming back five stars on the App Store.

The CEO speaks highly of the effort put in by the Dash Core team to make this a reality, mentioning team member ‘quantumexplorer’ as an individual who helped ensure the delivery of a nearly flawless product.

He added:

The care and detail he instilled throughout the app are evidence of his passion for the Dash project.

Dashing Forward

The announcement of Apple-approved status brought with it a nice price spike. With Ether’s recent losses, the two currencies are nearly neck and neck when comparing the value of a single coin.

Though the short-term gains seemed fleeting, this new status puts Dash in a strong position for future growth. As a currency focused on transaction efficiency, access to the App Store allows Dash to fully leverage their competitive advantage at point-of-sale retail locations.

Now that Dash applications are available in both Apple and Android ecosystems, users of the official Dash wallet can expect to see full support of instant transactions, updated UI design, and the inclusion of many of the features and enhancements users requested over the years.

These advances, in conjunction with Taylor’s vision and the dedicated Dash team, all signal a strong future for the digital asset.
