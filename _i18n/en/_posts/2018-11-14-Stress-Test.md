Dashâ€™s network processed a historic number of transactions during a recent stress test, far surpassing the previous record for a Bitcoin-based network held by Bitcoin Cash.

On the 11th of November, a pre-planned stress test was launched on the Dash network, run by Delta Engine, the company behind MyDashWallet. The stress test broke previous records by reaching over 3 million in a 24-hour period, passing the previous Dash high of 464,000 during an impromptu stress test in July of this year, and exceeding the previous record for a Bitcoin-based blockchain set by Bitcoin Cash in September, 2.1 million, by nearly 50%.

Scaling research was previously conducted by Arizona State University, concluding that Dash could easily scale to near-PayPal levels with relative ease. This new stress test shows that even with 2mb blocks, Dash can process nearly ten times the transaction load that strained the Bitcoin network in late 2017.
