New test results suggest Dash (DASH) is a near-infinitely scalable cryptocurrency network. The head of Dash Core believes it could soon rival centralized payment providers, including PayPal.

A stress test two weeks ago found the Dash protocol could process 3 million transactions within a 24-hour period. At approximately 35 transactions per second, the network’s capacity was four times higher than in a previous test, conducted during the summer. It represents a new all-time high for Dash, which forked from Bitcoin (BTC) in 2014.

The test was a community-driven initiative; transaction fees were paid from donations. Dash Core Group, the company chiefly responsible for the network’s development, observed how the network functioned under high capacity. The tests showed Dash was highly scalable, with the potential to expand to meet growing demand. “The test showed Dash was very capable of processing a large number of transactions,” Ryan Taylor, the CEO of Dash Core, told Crypto Briefing.

Researchers from Arizona State University, who also observed the tests, concluded Dash’s blockchain architecture meant it could scale up to whatever size it needed to be. “They determined that there was no upper limit for transaction capacity,” said Taylor.
