<p>Like all blockchain-based networks, Dash has been a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) from the start. But unlike almost all networks that are forked from or similar to Bitcoin, Dash’s ecosystem has been <a href="http://bitcoinist.net/how-dash-dao-work/">massively remodeled</a> since its birth.</p>
<p>In August 2015, 10% of Dash’s block reward became available for funding whatever the network deemed necessary above and beyond its miner and masternode infrastructure. The following month in September, the first <a href="https://dashninja.pl/budgets.html">payouts</a> were voted upon by Dash’s then ~3100 masternodes.</p>
<p>Contractors</p>
<p>The first proposals to receive requisite “yes” votes from Dash’s masternodes were to hire various contractors. A <a href="https://www.dash.org/forum/threads/budget-proposal-promotion-reimbursement-core-team.6006/">“Core Team” salary</a> was voted in, supporting both full and part-time contractors under an umbrella fund created by lead developer Evan Duffield.</p>
<p>Andy Freer has been hired to develop Dash’s forthcoming <a href="http://dash.org/evolution">Evolution</a>, and Ira Miller of Git Guild has been hired to integrate Dash into a series of <a href="https://www.dashwhale.org/p/lamassu-integration">Lamassu ATMs</a>.</p>
<p>Projects &amp; Events</p>
<p>In addition to ongoing contractor payments, many standalone projects have been funded:</p>
<p>In a category that might be called “basics,” there’s been the creation of a Dash <a href="https://www.dash.org/forum/threads/october-2015-budget-proposal.6234/">foundation</a>, the web design of Dash’s <a href="https://www.dash.org/forum/threads/october-2015-budget-proposal.6234/">homepage</a>, the purchase of domain <a href="https://www.dashwhale.org/p/dash-org-dec-replace">Dash.org</a>, and the acquisition of <a href="https://www.dashwhale.org/p/dashtalk-acquisition">DashTalk forum</a>.</p>
<p>For general usability, there’s been the funding of <a href="https://www.dash.org/forum/threads/october-2015-budget-proposal.6234/">“liquidity providers”</a> to decrease PrivateSend mixing times, coding of <a href="https://www.dash.org/forum/threads/october-2015-budget-proposal.6234/">Electrum wallet</a> for Dash support, a Dash debit card via <a href="https://www.dashwhale.org/p/dash-debit-card">SpectroCoin</a>, integration with hardware wallets such as Trezor and KeepKey, a vendor-geared <a href="https://www.dashwhale.org/p/Wifi-Portal">Wi-Fi portal</a>, a <a href="https://www.dashwhale.org/p/dashpay-woocommerce">WooCommerce</a> “Pay with Dash” plugin, and an integration with the <a href="https://www.dashwhale.org/p/ROKOS-permanent-add">ROKOS</a> operating system.</p>
<p>And in the promotional category, there’s been material distribution at a <a href="https://www.dash.org/forum/threads/budget-proposal-dash-on-the-aquidab%C3%A3-tennis-open-campaign-reimbursement.6175/">Brazilian tennis match</a>, <a href="https://www.dashwhale.org/p/Sponsor-DailyDecrypt">sponsorship of The Daily Decrypt</a>, <a href="https://www.dashwhale.org/p/Alex-ru-Promotion-1">promotional graphics</a> by Alex-ru, the <a href="http://dashndrink.com/">DashnDrink</a> vending machine with InstantSend support, a four month marketing campaign from <a href="http://vanbex.com/">The Vanbex Group</a>, and a three month video campaign of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLiFMZOlhgsYJPIiG0bjT1_SuT5h7NqPCC"><i>DASH: Detailed</i></a>.</p>
<p>Speeches and presentations have also been funded, given at the Latin American Bitcoin Conference, Miami’s TNABC, Amsterdam’s Bitcoin Wednesday, Satoshi RoundTable, and Anarchapulco.</p>
<p>Policies &amp; ‘No’ Votes</p>
<p>Several proposals have received “no” votes, from hiring a specific marketing agency to “catch-all” proposals for sending un-allocated coins to a “core” fund; from changing Dash’s mining algorithm <a href="https://www.dashwhale.org/p/change-X11">away from X11</a> to funding research for “proof-of-labour” security alternatives.</p>
<p>Policy matters have also been decided, such as increasing Dash’s block size cap <a href="https://www.dashwhale.org/p/2mb-blocksize">from 1MB to 2MB</a> should it become necessary (“yes”) to de-activating Dash’s YouTube channel mirror (“no”).</p>
<p>Effects on Capitalization &amp; Network</p>
<p>When the new DAO was adopted by the network in August 2015, Dash’s market capitalization was roughly $18 million USD. Now, ten months later, that number has tripled to $58 million USD. This puts Dash near its post-release all time high capitalization of $60 million USD — a feat many, and perhaps most, blockchain networks have not accomplished.</p>
<p>The network’s voterbase and infrastructure has also grown, as masternode count has increased 20% from an initial ~3100 to today’s ~3900.</p>
