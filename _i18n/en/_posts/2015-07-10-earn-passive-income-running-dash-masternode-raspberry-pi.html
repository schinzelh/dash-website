<p>Why would you want to earn passive income as a <a href="http://cointelegraph.com/news/114589/dash-masternodes-now-receiving-half-the-block-reward" target="_blank">Dash Masternode</a>?</p>
<p>First, one can get up and running with just a Raspberry Pi (also in a dedicated server or in a VPS), which is small and inexpensive. Second, the return-on-investment (ROI) is currently estimated at 17 % per year.</p>
<p>The Dash blockchain has set itself apart as the world's only currency to incentive its nodes with regular payment. Masternodes earn 47.5 % of the Dash block reward, which puts their earnings on par with Dash's miners.</p>
<p>With some initial collateral and around US$50 to invest in hardware, you too can join the savvy group of earners running a Dash Masternode on a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/" target="_blank">Raspberry Pi</a>.</p>
<h2>Pi Time</h2>
<p>We interviewed two current Masternodes operators about their costs, setups, and recommendations. <a href="https://dashtalk.org/" target="_blank">Dash Talk</a> members <strong>Mangled Blue</strong> and <strong>Fuzzyduck</strong> both use the Raspberry Pi 2, which costs about US$40. They've added to it an $US8 microSD card (8GB).</p>
<p>Mangled Blue says that he also used an HDMI cable, HDMI monitor, a USB keyboard, and a USB mouse. He indicates that it's possible to use a cell phone charger for power, or a microUSB-b to USB cable. Lastly, he connects his Pi with an Ethernet cable to his Internet modem, as he doesn't recommend using Wi-Fi, though he concedes that it could work. He adds:</p>
<blockquote><p>“I might not know every little detail about DASH or other cryptos, but having a Masternode    keeps me involved. It also forces me to learn something new - I knew nothing about Linux this time last year.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Fuzzyduck says that the Raspberry Pi 1 only had 512MB of RAM, which may not have been enough to run a Masternode. But the Raspberry Pi 2 – boasting a full gigabyte of RAM – does the trick. He says:</p>
<blockquote><p>“My Pi2 is running super-stable at the moment, and I hope it remains this way for the coming versions. I would like to see more people just try it.”</p></blockquote>
<h2>Collateral</h2>
<p>A collateral of 1,000 Dash is required to run a Masternode. This amount remains in the user's possession (no private keys are transferred to anyone else). The user can rescind their Masternode status at any time by reclaiming their collateral.</p>
<p>The collateral scheme is designed to make a malicious takeover of the network (a “51 % attack”) cost-prohibitive for an attacker. It also has a side benefit of stabilizing Dash's price, making it more attractive as a currency.</p>
<p>Interested in running a Masternode, but don't have the full collateral amount? Not a problem. <em>“Even if you don't have the 1,000 Dash required, we can find you people to pair up with –  that's how I got started,”</em> says Mangled Blue. <em>“You'll find a lot of good info and people in the forums to get you up and running.”<br />
</em></p>
<h2>Earnings</h2>
<p><em>“After running the Masternode stable for months now, I can totally say it already paid for itself for sure!”</em> says Fuzzyduck. <em>“Current price is US$3 per Dash. My Pi2 cost about US$35. I earn three Dash every four days. Do the math.”</em></p>
<p>And the payout isn't the only perk for Fuzzyduck. He continues, <em>“Since we are all technerds, we love to tinker with hardware and software – just for the fun of it! If I can do it, you can too.”</em></p>
<h2>Proper Security &amp; Risk Management</h2>
<p>Dash Talk user <strong>Flare</strong> chimed in on security. He says:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Running a publicly accessible host always requires security measures – the same security rules   which apply for a VPS also apply for a home-run Pi (e.g. enable firewall and disable remote root login).”</p></blockquote>
<p>And in the event that your home network is breached, your 1,000 Dash collateral is still safe, as neither a Pi nor a VPS ever stores your private keys.</p>
<h2>Fringe Benefits</h2>
<p>A Dash Masternode does more than just provide paid services to the network (namely the hugely important Darksend and InstantX). Each new node also adds to Dash's decentralization – a key component for any peer-to-peer operation that aims to achieve resilience and staying power.</p>
<p>Just how decentralizing are Dash's Masternode incentives already? Crunch these numbers: Bitcoin's market cap is nearly US$4 billion, and it runs on 6,000 nodes. In contrast, Dash's market cap is only US$17 million – a mere half a percent of Bitcoin's market – but it runs nearly 50% of the nodes at 2,650 and counting.</p>
