As the crypto market continues to correct, we've seen involvement increasing in the space behind the scenes.

More [**crypto jobs**](https://news.bitcoin.com/angellist-number-crypto-job-listings-doubled/ "crypto jobs") are available than ever before, supporting the drastic rise in altcoins available since 2017.

To further support the [**mass adoption**](https://www.investinblockchain.com/4-keys-mass-adoption-bitcoin/ "mass adoption") of cryptocurrencies, CoinFlip has been installing crypto ATMs all over the world, and they've just added 80+ new Dash-compatible ATMs.

**Dash Expands Reach**
----------------------

Daniel Polotsky, the [**CoinFlip**](https://www.coinflip.tech/ "CoinFlip") CEO, sees the addition of Dash as a natural next step for his company. Since Dash's focus has always been on the point-of-sale problem, and has remained a top 15 cryptocurrency according to its market cap, the integration is a big step in the right direction for [**Dash**](https://www.investinblockchain.com/what-is-dash/ "Dash").

Although Dash already had a growing network of ATMs worldwide, their partnership with CoinFlip almost doubled their ATM count in the United States overnight.

A majority of their ATMs are located in the U.S. and Europe, and according to estimates, the total number of Dash ATMs is now around 418.

For a bit of context, as of July 2018 there is an estimated [**3,400**](https://coinatmradar.com/ "3,400") Bitcoin-compatible ATMs worldwide, a number that continues to increase despite the recent downturn in the market.
