ByteFederal, a digital currency ATM operator based in Florida, has enabled DASH transactions on eight of its BTMs (Bitcoin teller machines) located in Florida.

More recently, BitcoinNW, a cryptocurrency ATM company in Oregon, launched its third DASH ATM in Oregon last month. 

But unlike BitcoinNW, ByteFederal's ATMs charges a hefty 14.8% markup and only allow for fiat-to-crypto operations. With the new additions by BitcoinNM and ByteFederal, the digital currency DASH now has a total of 13 active ATMs within the U.S.
