<p dir="ltr">Contributing an entire block reward “blindly to mining” to secure transactions is an act of stupidity says Ryan Taylor, head of finance at Dash, an open source peer-to-peer cryptocurrency.</p>
<p dir="ltr">His reference is a clear shot at the world’s leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization, Bitcoin (approximately US $10.5 billion), and its policy of directing all financial rewards by way of new coins to miners.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Taylor’s position is of course one biased by his affiliation to Dash. However, the facts offered remain stalwart realities that Dash’s governance structure and budgetary system are an industry-leading example.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“[Bitcoin is] facing centralization on a couple of different fronts,” says Taylor, “[but] the bigger issue is why on Earth is it optimal to devote 100 percent of the network’s resources to a single task out of many that are needed? It’s ridiculously wasteful.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">It is no secret the Bitcoin Foundation — the organization founded in 2012 by then Bitcoin lead developer Gavin Andresen to “foster education, engage in advocacy, increase adoption and encourage development of bitcoin and blockchain technology worldwide” — fell on hard financial times last year.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Taylor explained that Dash’s network, in contrast, “allocates only the amount we feel is needed toward transactional security and mining.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The “we” above is in reference to Dash’s decentralized governance structure where Masternode owners — Dash’s second tier of incentivized nodes — vote on proposals.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“These can be needs that the community proposes and it can be needs that the core team proposes to the network,” says Taylor.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Forty-five percent of overall funds are contributed to mining, 45 percent to infrastructure, and 10 percent is devoted to network needs.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Ultimately those funds have to be approved by the Masternode owners through voting and that 10 percent is allocated toward a variety of different needs.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">There are powerful network effects at play with this, says Taylor.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Since that budget system has launched,” which was last August, “the price has gone up significantly, .............</p>
