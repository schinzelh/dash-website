As [we did in 2017](https://freekeene.com/2017/05/25/celebrating-bitcoin-pizza-day-makerspace-golf-course-jiu-jitsu-businesses-now-accepting-bitcoin-in-keene/), Keene cryptocurrency fans got together yesterday, May 22nd, to celebrate Bitcoin Pizza Day. What is Bitcoin Pizza Day? On May 22nd of 2010, a computer programmer made the first recorded real-life bitcoin purchase -- two pizzas for 10,000 bitcoin. Today, that 10,000 BTC is worth over $80 Million dollars. A year ago, it was worth $25 Million.

We gathered at [Little Zoe's Take and Bake](http://littlezoes.com/) and ordered several pizzas. However instead of paying with BTC, as we did last year, this time we paid with DASH. Why DASH? Last year during the dramatic spike in fees on the Bitcoin Core network, [several local businesses began accepting DASH](https://freekeene.com/2017/12/08/all-cryptocurrencies-set-record-420-billion-market-cap-as-nh-retailers-launch-dash-acceptance/) as an alternative to BTC, to give their customers a choice.

In order to spend cryptocurrency, it's the buyer who pays the network fee for processing the transaction (this is the opposite of the credit card system, where the merchant takes the fee out of their profit). Given that today [fees to send BTC](https://bitcoinfees.info/) are typically about $0.40 and to send DASH about $0.01, it's a no-brainer. No one would choose to spend BTC when a better option is available.

That better option is [DASH](http://dash.org/), aka "Digital Cash", a cryptocurrency that confirms four times faster than BTC and has really taken off at retail locations across southern New Hampshire. It proliferated because NH-based crypto point-of-sale merchant processor [Anypay](http://anypay.global/) introduced DASH first with its release of their POS software in 2017. In fact, in an interview with Albert, the operator of [DiscoverDash.com](http://discoverdash.com/), a website that shows the physical locations of DASH-accepting businesses across the world, he told me that Keene is number three in the world for real-life DASH acceptance, behind Caracas, Venezuela at number one and Portsmouth, NH at number two!

So, happy Bitcoin Pizza Day!
