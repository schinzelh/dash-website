Dash Evolution has been designed as a scalable and user-friendly currency platform for mass adoption. Evan Duffield and Andy Freer of Dash Labs and Dash Core CTO, respectively have developed a roadmap for reaching this goal, and have provided a summary of this roadmap on Dash.org.

The user capacity will increase with each development stage. Dash plans to double the number of developers with each release.

Dash is one of the fastest growing cryptocurrencies, having surpassed $1 billion in market capitalization in recent months. As of Thursday, Dash was the seventh largest crypto with a $1.345 billion market cap, according to coinmarketcap.com.

The developers will use each incremental release as a framework for more development. There are various new technologies needed to create such an experience, all of which will strengthen the infrastructure supporting the network to ensure it can handle the transaction loads and data storage needs of a mass market.

Masternodes will be tested using “state transitions.” The system will give a mathematically predictable way to determine the quality of masternode service. Masternodes falling below a threshold of activity will be removed from the masternode list under a new system called “masternode blocks.”

New Software To Deploy

A software called IPFS will deploy DashDrive. IPFS is a P2P file system that can handle most network sharing, syncing and redundancy operations. DashDrive is an internal facing system that holds user objects within the network. There is no public facing system for storage of non-Dash information.

Network operations will scale in a way that will allow exponential growth. Masternode hardware requirements will increase to serve more users with greater functionality.

The network will eventually finance the creation of masternode specific hardware which will increase the throughput significantly.

Dash 12.1 Complete

Core developers have focused on deploying Dash 12.1, which links existing Dash codebase with future Evolution releases.

The team will soon open a large amount of private documentation to ensure complete transparency.

Dash has also created a new team based in Hong Kong called Dash Labs to focus on developing custom hardware under Duffield and Freer. Dash Labs will create the first open-source versions of different hardware types. The goal is to keep digital currency transparent while minimizing the economic advantages of closed-source, proprietary technology.

Advanced, open-source ASICs would remove most advantages of privately developed ASICs. Mining centralization could be reduced as a result.
