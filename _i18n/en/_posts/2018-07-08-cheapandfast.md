Overview
--------

[Dash](https://www.dash.org/) (DSH), like [Bitcoin Cash](https://blockexplorer.com/news/what-is-bitcoin-cash-the-worlds-currency/) and [Litecoin](https://blockexplorer.com/news/what-is-litecoin-the-silver-to-bitcoins-gold/), aspires to be a common currency, one that can be spent or saved like any fiat currency. It emerged in 2014, before the boom of cryptocurrencies and so-called "altcoins", and has slowly built a stable market presence within the top ten tokens by market capitalization.

One is increased privacy, by use of a built-in transaction mixing system called PrivateSend. This system breaks transactions into preset increments of 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100, or 1000 Dash. These denominations are mixed with increments within transactions made by other users so that they are in essence shuffled in between senders and recipients. This makes it hard to trace the history of any Dash amount, preserving the privacy of users.

Another feature is a built-in system of governance by using masternodes. Bitcoin, according to Dash supporters, was a great technological revolution but has no methodology in place for participating developers or users to direct the course of the evolution of Bitcoin. If there is ...............
