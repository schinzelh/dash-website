On todays show we kick it off with Overstock.com CEO Patrick Byrne at the Wyohackathon at the University of Wyoming. Patrick talks about both Overstock and Tzero as well as a little bit about Marijuana. We close the show with Caitlin Long also at the Wyohackathon. Caitlin is the creator of the event as well as the originator of the Wyoming Blockchain Law. Sandwiched in between is an earlier interview with Eugenia Alcala of Dash Caracas in Venezuela. Eugenia is responsible for the Dash push in Venezuela which has led to over 1500 Dash accepting merchants in the country.
