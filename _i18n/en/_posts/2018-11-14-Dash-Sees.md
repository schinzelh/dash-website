Dash, one of the Top 15 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, is seeing more and more adoption, especially compared to the results a year ago, but the total payment volume and number of downloaded mobile wallets has been decreasing, according to their Q3 results.

“We saw mixed signals on user growth, but overall the metrics appeared steady despite the market price declines,” CEO Ryan Taylor said during a quarterly conference call, adding, “Usage metrics were also strong, including record trading volumes. However, it’s important to note that the community performed a stress test in July that increased several of these metrics [such as transaction count, private send and instant send] in an artificial way.”

According to the report, Dash now has 47,750 daily active addresses - an increase of more than 36% compared to last year, but only slightly more than last quarter. More than half a million addresses hold more than USD 1, indicating actual use and not just creating an address for experimenting, which is an increase of 1,306% compared to last year. The average daily median transaction value is USD 30.5 - a steep decline from last year.
