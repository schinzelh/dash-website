You're going to want to watch today's show. That's all I'm going to say.Hi I'm Amanda B. Johnson and you're watching DASH: Detailed. To get started I'd like to combine former "Dash in the News" with "Business News" to just be "Business and Headlines.
"To start, check out this beautiful footage of a General Bytes CTM -- that is cryptocurrency teller machine -- dispensing Dash in exchange for paper cash. Dash is now supported on all General Bytes CTMs if the machine's operator chooses to enable it.Dash on General Bytes! <https://www.youtube.com/shared?ci=To4zcN95pVMTo> get the word out about this, General Bytes has started a Thunderclap campaign and they are still short of the 100 participants that they would like to sign up with either Twitter, Facebook, or Tumblr to spread the news on February 24th, that Dash can now be enabled on General Bytes.General Bytes Thunderclap campaign: <https://www.thunderclap.it/projects/52838-bring-dash-to-your-local-atm> Elsewhere, the online exchange and trading platform BitMEX has just enabled Dash derivatives. If youknow next to nothing about the legacy fiat economy, like myself, you may wonder what does that mean? Well apparently it means that people will be able to use Bitcoin -- not Dash but Bitcoin -- on BitMEX to make bets about Dash's future prices.Hey, who doesn't like gambling while they gamble? As one Dash Slack user pointed out, this may not initially bring an increase in Dash ownership but it certainly brings more exposure.Dash derivatives on BitMEX: <https://twitter.com/BitMEXdotcom/status/829576365364031494> In headlines CoinTelegraph's Frisco d'Anconia published an article called, "Why Dash Dislodged Ethereum Classic for the Sixth Spot on CoinMarketCap".Dash dislodged ETC: <https://cointelegraph.com/news/why-dash-dislodged-ethereum-classic-from-number-6-place-on-coinmarketcap> And the 12.1 release was covered elsewhere, here in NewsBTC, here in EconoTimes, and here in CoinJournal.Sentinel in EconoTimes <http://www.econotimes.com/Dash-rolls-out-major-software-upgrade-v121-Sentinel-525895Sentinel> in NewsBTC <http://www.newsbtc.com/2017/02/06/dash-sentinel-upgrade-payments/> Sentinel in Coinjournal <http://coinjournal.net/dash-sentinel-evolution/> Finally in headlines, Dash made the #4 spot in Bitcoinists list of best performing cryptocurrency of January 2017. Interesting to note however, is that spots 1-3 are occupied by colored Bitcoins. So colored coins aside, Dash was the best performing native cryptocurrency for January. Cool.Dash is 4th: <http://bitcoinist.com/cryptos-outperformed-bitcoin-january/>
Now let's talk about network statistics.At this time Dash 12.1 and 12.0 are still playing nicely together, which is to say there has been no enforcement or spork activated. What you ask? I thought it was set for February 12th? So did I. So did many others. So to get clarification on this I reached out to Dash's Quality Assurance Manager Flare, orHolger Schinzel.Holger said, in so many words, that at this time the network is still what he would consider indecisive, and an indecisive Dash network has the propensity to create an accidental fork by part of the network thinking that masternode A should be paid and part of the network thinking that in the same block, masternode B should be paid.In order to prevent such a scenario from happening Flare says that he and other core team members are monitoring several parameters which indicate network health. And that while the network is growing alittle healthier every day, it is not yet healthy enough to turn on the enforcement spork.All of that aside, our current masternode count is actually at an all-time high 4,396 to be precise.Masternode count: <http://178.254.23.111/~pub/masternode_count.png> Of these, with more than 75% have upgraded to 12.1 and roughly 6% appear to be in the process of doing so. That leaves us with about 18% of masternodes who have not yet upgraded at all.In mining, today's hashrate is 2.21 Tarahashes.Hashrate &amp; full node count: <http://bitinfocharts.com> And it ought to be said of Dash's miners that 100% of them have upgraded to 12.1. Well done.100% of hashpower has switched: <https://twitter.com/Dashpay/status/830019978367741953> To put this hashrate into context here is our three-month chart, our one year chart, and the lifetime chart.In other network stats you may have noticed -- especially if you're a masternode owner -- that some of Dash's miners -- not a lot, but about 7% of them -- are cheating. What does this mean? Well it means that instead of sending half of the block reward to masternodes, which they usually do, during this transition period while 12.1 and 12.0 are co-operating, they are able to instead keep that payment for themselves.Now, this cheating mechanism will no longer be available once the enforcement spork happens. And of course it should be noted that 93% of Dash's hash power is being honest but it does bring to mind a comment that lead developer Evan Duffield made in a podcast about a year ago -- about future plans to require that hash power be collateralized. What a forward-thinking guy.Now let's move to development updates.Dash now has CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY. Hurray! What does that mean?Ok, so when the majority of Dash's hash power switched to 12.1 we incorporated certain elements of 
Bitcoin's codebase -- as we have a Bitcoin codebase -- and we update from them from time to time.Among these updates was a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal, or BIP 65. And BIP 65 is also called CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY. To find out more about what that means for Dash, I reached out to developer moocowmoo.He said that CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY enables coins to be locked away for a day, a month, even a year, and only able to be retrieved at later dates, which he mentioned has implications for things like smart contracts or escrow. In short, and in moocowmoo's words, Dash can do more tricks now.Dash has CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY now: <https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/checklocktimeverify-or-how-a-time-lock-patch-will-boost-bitcoin-s-potential-1446658530/> In other development updates, if you are having trouble using Electrum Dash you would not be the only one. There is a support thread going on here and you may find that there are some fixes for any problems you may be experiencing.Electrum-Dash Remedy: <https://support.node40.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002838488-My-Electrum-Dash-wallet-will-not-send-a-transaction-after-the-update-to-12-1> And finally in development updates, InstantSend -- that is Dash's capability to instantly confirm a transaction -- is not working during the transition time, that is, during the time that 12.1 and 12.0 are still playing nicely together. So don't try to use it, you would just be disappointed.Now to price movement.There is a bit of a flurry going on, though it may have completely died out by the time you watch this video, or it may have reached new heights of hysteria. Nevertheless, at the time being, Dash's price in U.S. dollars is $18.08 s a coin.This gives us a market capitalization of roughly $128 million, with 7.1 million coins available and a 24-hour trade volume of $1.9 million worth of Dash.Current price in USD and other charts: <http://coinmarketcap.com> Let's look at some historical charts for market cap: here is three months, here is one year, and here is lifetime, or three years ago until now.At this time allow me to correct an error that I made two shows ago, which was the expected date of Dash's decrease in inflation -- or that is, new coins created.See every year Dash's new coins created decreases by about 7%. I had reported before that that decrease was set to happen on February 12th and I was wrong. It's actually start to happen in the afternoon of March 4th.And now to social happenings.The winners of Dash Force's meetup contest have been announced and they were two. First was 
community member Milliarderko for his meet up in Krasnodar, Russia. And second with community member BlueTrader for his meet up in Suwanee, GA. Both received 7.75 Dash in compensation. Congratulations!And of course let's not forget that an honorable mention was given to the meetup held in Kazakhstan. I could never not enjoy saying that word. Not ever.DashForce meetup contest winners: <https://www.dash.org/forum/threads/dashforce-meetup-contest.12802/> In other social happenings the video footage of dash core team member Robert Wiecko presenting at ICE Totally Gaming in London has been released.Gaming presentation by Robert Wiecko: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpFuwOBbCKg> And elsewhere, I had the opportunity to give an interview about Dash to the popular YouTube channel Anarchast. The host -- Jeff Berwick -- was talking about Bitcoin on his show way back in 2011, and so it was very fitting and very fortuitous that he allowed the first chat about Dash on his show now.Anarchast interview: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8GwsmnHE3Rk> That's it for DASH: Detailed this week my friends. Thank you for joining me and I hope you will comeback for next week's episode, which will be published on Wednesday at 12 pm EST, as per usual.Alright, see you then!
