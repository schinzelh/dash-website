We're excited to announce the release of [DIP 8](https://github.com/dashpay/dips/blob/master/dip-0008.md), which details a mechanism for mitigating 51% mining attacks on the Dash blockchain. This protection mechanism, called ChainLocks, builds upon the [Long Living Masternode Quorum (LLMQ)](https://blog.dash.org/introducing-long-living-masternode-quorums-76ea8b23a85a) system established by DIPs [6](https://github.com/dashpay/dips/blob/master/dip-0006.md) and [7](https://github.com/dashpay/dips/blob/master/dip-0007.md).

You can [read the details about DIP 8 on GitHub](https://github.com/dashpay/dips/blob/master/dip-0008.md) or a less-technical overview of DIP 8 titled [Mitigating 51% attacks with LLMQ-based ChainLocks](https://blog.dash.org/mitigating-51-attacks-with-llmq-based-chainlocks-7266aa648ec9) on the Dash blog.
