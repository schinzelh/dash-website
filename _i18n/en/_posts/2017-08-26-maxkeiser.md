Max Keiser is asking Dash to contribute $500,000 towards his forthcoming TV show “The Great American Pilgrimage.”

Together with Stephen Baldwin, Keiser intends to shoot 16 episodes of a road trip in which he quizzes the US public on their political motivations.

Having announced the plan in July, Keiser has unveiled a full sponsorship offer for the Dash community, which would see the privacy-focused altcoin gain considerable publicity from the show.

“The DASH community is amazing,” he told Cointelegraph.

“My goal on this epic journey is to continue waking people up to crypto - like the Keiser Report's been doing since 2011 when Bitcoin was $3. Global finance needs to be reimagined and rebuilt and DASH is on the forefront of this revolution.”

Keiser has been a fan of Dash since at least 2014, mentioning the project on the Keiser Report in March that year.

A dedicated video has accompanied the offer, in which the RT host discusses the value for money behind the $500,000 price tag.

“We're making history right now with this sponsorship,” Dash PR coordinator Mark Mason continued.

“This is the biggest budget proposal in Blockchain history ever! It is also Dash's biggest monthly treasury budget to date at just under $2 mln. The support from the Dash community has been outstanding.”

If the deal goes ahead, filming could start as early as September, with the entire run scheduled to take one month.

“I'm incredibly humbled to be working with Stephen Baldwin, Max Keiser and Stacy Herbert to educate the public about this new ‘magic Internet money’ movement and why Dash is the champion of digital cash,” Mason added.
