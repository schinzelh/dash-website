<p>Due to some issues that were brought up by a researcher, we've revised the Darksend protocol extensively to enhance the anonymity provided. It's very important that all clients on the Dash network update. </p>
<p><strong>Users Required To Update:</strong></p>
<p>Pools<br />
Exchanges<br />
Darksend Users<br />
Normal Clients<br />
Masternodes</p>
<p><strong>Changes made in this release:<br />
</strong><br />
- Masternodes can now make a limited number of zero-fee transaction for Darksend. These are special transactions that require a signature that only the masternodes can create.<br />
- Darksend now has no fees to track what-so-ever, all that will ever be in Darksend transactions are Darksend denominations.<br />
- Added queue gaming protection<br />
- Clients remember which masternodes they've connected to in the past and won't use them against.<br />
- Dsee/Dseep messages have been fixed so they only take newer signatures than the one they have<br />
- 2 different kinds of client crashes have been fixed<br />
- Split up main.cpp into core.cpp<br />
- Split up darksend.cpp into masternode.cpp, activemasternode.cpp and instantx.cpp<br />
- Added modular ProcessMessages for Darksend, Masternodes and InstantX<br />
- Client can now join sessions with any other users</p>
