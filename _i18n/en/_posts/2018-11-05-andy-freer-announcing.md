Hi all,

Now that the Evo protocol design is pretty much complete and implementations are running on DevNet I feel my main work in Core is done and I met my commitment to Evan that I made back in 2016 to help move Dash beyond raw, hard to use payments to solve a mainstream, usable, scalable and economical cryptcurrency for the future.

With BU, DML and the Platform designed and running on Dev Net for the MVP version and LLMQ coming later, i'm happy with the results and also with devs like UdjinM6 and Codablock on L1 and Shumkov and Anton and Werner on L2 taking the protocol design forward, and i'm always available to them to input on future protocol design, but I believe the underlying architecture for mainstream adoption is there for the foreseeable future, through creating new use-cases for Dash currency that are hardly obvious to most people today, and that these devs through working together can take that forward better than I can personally.

My main focus now after some downtime will be on creating DAPs for Evolution in some new flexible and creative capacity, i.e. writing DAPs and helping others to write DAPs, as its killer DAPs that will be the key to mainstream adoption of Dash currency by providing new incentives and reasons to signup, integrate, use and monetize with Dash online as a differential to centralized payment alternatives. Once that has traction, it will lead to a critical mass of Dash ownership to then warrant uptake within the larger financial system and commerce markets and actual mainstream payments.

It's been a pleasure and I feel privileged to have worked with so many smart and talented developers, I believe the dev team is the best in the space and provided they can appreciate and stay focused on Evan's vision which is embodied in the current Evo design, I believe we have the potential to grow a usage and usecase base much bigger than is imagined today with the current crypto space through which increased decentralization and personal independence in all aspects of people's lives can only be a good thing, and I remain fully committed to that larger goal.

Best

Andy Freer
