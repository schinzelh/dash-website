An interview with Bradley Zastrow, Director of Business Development at Dash.  In this interview, we discuss Dash, the top digital currency for payments, announcement of a retail partnership with Rewards.com, one of the leading loyalty rewards websites. Through the partnership, Rewards.com users can earn Dash on purchases made at online department stores such as Macy's, Neiman Marcus, Sears, and Bloomingdales. This partnership is notable because Dash will be the first digital currency payment method supported by Rewards.com, marking another mainstream adoption of cryptocurrency in retail.

Our discussion was on the impact of blockchain technology.
