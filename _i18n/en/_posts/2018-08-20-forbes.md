Despite the current market cap roller coster, there are behind-the-scenes signals showing the strength of the novel cryptocurrency incumbents. Coinbase made [$1 billion](https://www.businessinsider.com/coinbase-reportedly-made-more-than-1-billion-in-revenues-last-year-2018-1?IR=T) in 2017, the 13-month old Chinese exchange, Binance, is projected to make [$1 billion in 2018](https://www.businessinsider.com/binance-cryptocurrency-exchange-profit-prediction-2018-7?IR=T), and cryptocurrency foundations, [such as Stellar](https://dashboard.stellar.org/), hold tens of billions in cryptocurrency ready for deployment. All this new wealth is driving the creation of investment funds by cryptocurrency companies and cryptocurrency foundations.

I sat down and spoke with three different organizations, BitMEX, ConsenSys, and Dash Core Group Inc, to learn more about why this is happening and what these new kinds of investment funds are seeking.

BitMEX, short for Bitcoin Mercantile Exchange, is likely the largest cryptocurrency exchange you have never heard of. Earlier this year, BitMEX had the largest trading volume of any exchange in a single twenty four hour period, with a total of [1MM BTC](https://cryptovest.com/news/bitmex-records-highest-trading-volume-ever-at-1m-btc/) changing hands. BitMEX is a Bitcoin-only trading exchange, built for experienced traders, with the capability to offer 100x leverage for trades. I spoke with Max Shapiro, a venture associate at BitMEX to learn more about why they created a venture fund.

Shapiro explains,

> We created the arm in early 2018 with two goals: 1) Grow the ecosystem focusing on specific themes that are strategic to BitMEX. 2) Understanding all of the opportunities and innovation taking place in this rapidly growing ecosystem

Bitcoin pierced the $600 mark for the first time  in two years  at the end of 2016 and [soared to nearly $20,000](https://www.coindesk.com/price/) by the end of 2017. Companies like BitMEX and my own company, [Bitwage](https://www.bitwage.com/), had a new influx of funds that needed to be put to work. At the same time, the number of new companies entering the industry grew significantly: new startups funded by venture capital or as Initial Coin Offerings, institutional investors entering into the trading market, and enterprises such as CBOE, ICE and Naver Line. Bitcoin companies that were considered startups just two years ago suddenly had the funds and the capabilities to seed new startups.

Shapiro goes on to describe the investment areas which are interesting for BitMEX.

> All of our themes are related to the traditional financial system, typically focused on encouraging institutional participation in the ecosystem. One of the big themes right now everyone is looking into is crypto custody. How can you successfully have custody of funds with the same level of vigor as the traditional financial system? We also will look at investments that are not directly related to cryptocurrency, but are complimentary, such as cyber security and anti-money laundering solutions.

While Bitcoin may have been leading the charge in terms of price increase and trading activity, Bitcoin is not the only cryptocurrency ecosystem with corporations building out venture arms. ConsenSys, a thousand person Ethereum consulting, software and infrastructure developing organization, started their venture arm in 2017. I spoke with Kavita Gupta, founder of ConsenSys ventures and previous investment analyst for the World Bank investment arm, to learn more about ConsenSys's new ventures.

> Consensys has four main arms: Labs, which has incubated over 48 products, like Metamask, Infura and Truffle. Solutions, a consultancy arm to develop solutions for government and enterprises. Academy one that provides education for developers. ConsenSys Capital is the last of the four, an external financial market group created in 2017. We decided to create ConsenSys Ventures as a separate legal entity to have more autonomy. The goal of ConsenSys ventures is to support projects in the space that do not make sense incubating from an early stage, but are still worth bringing to market.

Gupta goes on to talk about what ConsenSys Venture is interested in,

> We are not a liquidity player, we are a strategic player. We are not just capital, we work closely with companies to help them accelerate their projects. With thirty three offices around the world, we help companies obtain international exposure. We've invested in about ten companies so far. Previously, we were 100% Ethereum focused, however, we have since become 90% Ethereum focused, with the other 10% allocated to blockchain agnostic technology around infrastructure, network security, scalability and so on. Application levels are still 100% Ethereum focused.

When it comes to crypto corporate VCs, you see the world "strategic" investment come up a lot. However, unlike BitMEX, where strategic focuses more around the objectives of the company's interest in the ecosystem, ConsenSys's definition is more how they can help accelerate companies in their chosen missions.

Unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum, the two largest networks by size as well as number of companies working within the ecosystem, there are other public blockchain networks. While not having a plethora of massively profitable companies, they do have a significant amount of value to deploy via their tokens. Dash is one such network.

Currently the 13th largest cryptocurrency, with a market cap of [$1.2 billion](https://coinmarketcap.com/), Dash attempts to differentiate itself via a structured and decentralized governance model, something which Bitcoin and Ethereum lack. I spoke with Ryan Taylor, CEO of Dash Core Group and a former McKinsey associate partner, to learn a bit more about the governance model and how it allows for company investments.

> Dash was originally a non-profit foundation. Similar to other foundations, such as the BTC and LTC foundations, it was very hard to get donors. In addition to this, once money is donated, by function of being a foundation, the use of funds is quite limited. We created a new structure that has never been done before by creating Dash Core Group Inc., a Delaware C Corp. 100% of the shares in the company are issued to a trust. The beneficiaries of the trust are masternodes, users with over 1000 Dash Tokens who provide governance and maintain the blockchain. This means that Dash Core Group Inc. is owned by the network we serve. Although we are a C-Corp, we have no strong profit motive, and instead, draw our resources from the Dash Treasury System.
>
> To describe Dash Treasury, you need to understand how most other cryptocurrency works. Typically 100% of the transaction fees and new coins go to miners. However, in Dash, we realized that while network security is important to incentivize, we also want to incentivize network connectivity, node maintenance and development. In this way, 45% of the fees and new coins goes to miners, 45% goes to master nodes and then the last 10% goes into a treasury once a month.
>
> Anyone can submit a proposal to the treasury and the masternodes vote on whether to fund projects, paid out monthly. At the current valuation, $1.5 million in tokens are added to the treasury every month. You can see the current list of proposals at [dashvotetracker.com](http://dashvotetracker.com/). Dash Core Group is funded almost entirely through the Treasury, which is then able to engage on-behalf of the network like a C-Corp, with business development, software development, marketing, operations and even customer support for users.
