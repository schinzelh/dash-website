<p><b>The rise of Ethereum’s The DAO is certainly cause for excitement. However, for <a class="internalLink" href="https://www.dash.org/">Dash</a>, the prospect of successfully operating a decentralized autonomous organization is already old news.</b></p>
<p>Created in 2014 by Evan Duffield as “Darkcoin,” Dash quickly grew from a platform for highly-anonymized transactions to a full service network for payments, project funding and decentralized governance by protocol.</p>
<p><b>Dash: Two Years Ahead</b></p>
<p>With all the talk about The DAO, people seem to have forgotten — or simply don’t know — Dash has been providing DAO-like services for a couple of years.</p>
<p>With its Decentralized Governance by Blockchain (DGB) functionality, anyone can propose changes to Dash. Masternode owners host monthly votes on these proposals, which range from marketing and community-based decisions to direct modifications to Dash protocol.</p>
<p>Dash’s project budget is funded by 10 percent of the block reward, which is entered into a fund that can be used to finance Masternode-approved projects.</p>
<p>Unlike The DAO, Dash funds its projects with money internal to the network, produced by miners, and controlled at the protocol level by Masternodes.</p>
<p>This method of funding promotes network strength, creating a positive feedback loop of internal capitalization that gets injected right back into the system for projects to improve the protocol.</p>
<p>The DAO, on the other hand, operates on a system of conflicting incentives, which could set the organization up for bouts of massive devaluation and ether dumping.</p>
<p>By requiring people to purchase DAO tokens with ether, the organization has also set up a system that turn DAO voting rights into a tradeable commodity, opening the door to crypto-token trading and other similar perils, vulnerabilities like pump and dump schemes, fraud and theft.</p>
<p>DAO tokens could even become more of a target for speculative day traders than those with genuine interest in voting and developing new projects.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Dash, with its “internalized” system facilitating voting across Masternode owners, pushes forward project funding decisions to protocol questions without disruption.</p>
