Outreach is being done via the ASU inter-campus events calendar, to a few dozen ASU student organizations, a handful of relevant subreddits, the [Freedom's Phoenix](http://freedomsphoenix.com) crew, and others.

For those unable to attend -- I plan to record and upload the presentations. And I'll see about livestreaming the event too.
