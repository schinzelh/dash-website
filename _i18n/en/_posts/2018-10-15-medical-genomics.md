&quot;We describe the use of a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) to crypto-fund the single molecule sequencing and publication of a Type II Cannabis plant. This resulted in the construction of the most contiguous Cannabis genome assembly to date. The combined use of the Dash cryptocurrency, DAOs, and Pacific Biosciences sequencing delivered a 1.03 Gb genome with a N50 of 665Kb in 77 days from funding to public upload. This represents a 300 fold improvement in the contiguity of the first cannabis assemblies in 2011 and a 4 fold improvement over allcannabis assemblies to date. HiC data from Phase Genomics further improved the assembly to 894 contigs at an N50 of 5.4Mb. The genome is partially phased and 30% larger than previously reported. The CBCA, THCA and CBDA synthase gene clusters have been phased onto respective contigs demonstrating tandem repeat expansions.&quot;
