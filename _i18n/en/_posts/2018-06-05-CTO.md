The Dash Core team announced the hiring of a new CTO to round out its impressive development team.

The hiring of a new Chief Technical Officer was announced this week by the Dash Core team. Bob Carroll, the new CTO, officially joined the team at the end of May. According to Dash Core CEO Ryan Taylor, Carroll will bring an increasing level of organization to the team:

> "I am thrilled to have Bob Carroll filling out our management team. Bob is not only excited about the project and an excellent cultural fit with the team, but he is also an incredible personnel and organization developer with a strong track record of delivering against complex programs. I'm looking forward to working closely with Bob in the years ahead as we continue developing and expanding the Dash network."

The hiring of Carroll takes over the position previously occupied by Andy Freer, who has transitioned to occupy the Chief Architect role. Nathan Marley will be working closely with Carroll as Deputy CTO.

Another industry professional with decades of experience

The hiring represents yet another acquisition of a long-time industry professional from outside the small world of blockchain developers. Carroll previously worked as the CIO of the University of Phoenix, as well as working at Informix Software, North America Systems Engineers, and Everspring over the course of his 20+ year career. According to Carroll, he looks forward to applying his experience overseeing significant growth to the Dash Core team:

> "I've been actively involved in the dramatic growth of organizations and pioneering technologies over the past two decades, and I feel very fortunate to have the opportunity to join Dash at the forefront of the blockchain technology revolution. It's exciting to be able to use my database origins with my many years of CTO experience to work with the Dash Core team, and know that the best is yet to come for the Dash network and community."

Carroll is the latest of a series of professionals from major organizations to join the Core team. Dash Core's Business Development head [Brad Zastrow](https://www.dashforcenews.com/dash-core-hires-new-business-development-director/) claimed 17+ years of experience in the old payments world, including American Express, and Core's new CFO [Glenn Austin](https://www.dashforcenews.com/dash-core-group-hires-cfo-relieves-growing-pains/) has over 20 years of experience in the finance sector, including UBS, Morgan Stanley, and CitiGroup.

The technical groundwork for the Evolution platform is being laid

The restructuring of the development team comes as Dash lays the foundation for the upcoming Evolution update. The announcement of Dash Improvement Proposal (DIP) 2, 3, and 4, grouped under the greater goal of implementing [deterministic masternode lists](https://www.dashforcenews.com/dash-announces-deterministic-masternode-lists-in-major-structural-overhaul/), represents a major overhaul of Dash, which will enable the creation of a host of new functionality. The pull request to implement DIPs 2-4 was created late last month, to be included in the 12.4 release:

Before the release of 12.4 later this year, the 12.3 version must first be finalized and implemented. 12.3 is currently in open testing and is scheduled for release soon:

After the release of versions 12.3 and 12.4, the next scheduled release is 13.0, considered the first version of Evolution, which has been hinted at a release this year.
