In September, Bitcoin and blockchain experts and industry leaders from around the world will gather in Beijing, China to discuss the current state of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology as well as how each will impact the future.

The 2017 BTC & Blockchain International Summit will be held on September 9, 2017, at the Sofitel Wanda Beijing Hotel in Beijing, China. Attendance is expected to be well into the thousands and includes prominent members of the cryptocurrency community as well as representatives from media outlets and industry-leading businesses.

NOTABLE GUEST SPEAKERS

A preliminary list of guest speakers provided to Bitcoinist by the summit’s organizer, BitKan, reads like a Who’s Who list of the best and brightest in Bitcoin and blockchain technology. At the time of this writing, confirmed speakers include:

Blockchain.info Founder Nicolas Cary

Bitmain CEO Wu Jihan

Bitcoin.com CEO Roger Ver

Huobi CEO Li Lin

Dash Core team

Rootstock CEO Diego Gutiérrez Zaldívar

Wings CEO Stas Oskin

BitKan CEO Liu Yang

Although specific discussion panels have yet to be confirmed, topics are expected to cover the cryptocurrency industry and market conditions both in China and globally as well as current blockchain technology and projects and future applications.

One of the highlights of the summit is the much-anticipated premiere of what is being called “the First BTC Documentary about China”. The documentary, titled Bitcoin: Shape The Future, examines the history of Bitcoin in China as well as the emerging industries it has spawned.

According to a representative of BitKan:

The documentary introduces the history of Bitcoin in China since 2009. From mining factories to headquarters of exchanges, we have interviewed 20+ industry’s leaders to witness the developement of the whole bitcoin industry in China.
Shaping the Future of Cryptocurrency and Blockchain Tech

SHAPING THE FUTURE OF CRYPTOCURRENCY AND BLOCKCHAIN TECH

Recent record-breaking price surges of both Bitcoin and Ethereum, as well as the announcement of several high-profile blockchain projects, have focused the global spotlight on cryptocurrency and blockchain technology like never before. Private companies and government agencies alike are realizing the benefits that embracing this new technology can bring.

Such international attention also puts us at a crossroads. In a world of increasing government oversight, how do we move forward to achieve mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology without sacrificing privacy? How far-reaching are its possible application?

These are all questions that will impact the future of Bitcoin, cryptocurrency as a whole, and blockchain technology. The BTC & Blockchain International Summit, and events like it, give us a voice in shaping that future.

These are exciting times to be a part of the cryptocurrency community.
