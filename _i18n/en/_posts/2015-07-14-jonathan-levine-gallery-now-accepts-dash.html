<p>Jonathan LeVine Gallery is pleased to announce he will now accept Dash (Digital Cash), a cryptocurrency that allows for instantaneous transactions.</p>
<p>Jonathan LeVine has always had a dedication to the avant­garde, bringing to the forefront underground art with a unique counter­culture point of view. In 1994, he began independently curating exhibitions at punk and alternative rock venues in New Jersey and New York. In 2001, LeVine opened his own gallery called Tin Man Alley in New Hope, Pennsylvania. Four years later he renamed and moved the gallery to the epicenter of the contemporary art world, Manhattan’s Chelsea district, and became one of the first gallerists to sell fine art online.</p>
<p>Since 2005, Jonathan LeVine Gallery has been an essential venue for Street Art, ephemeral work placed in public urban environments, and Pop Surrealism, work influenced by illustration, comic book art and pop culture imagery. Over the last ten years the gallery has worked with over 300 artists and remains true to its mission of showing an alternative viewpoint within the New York art market.</p>
<p>Node40 assisted Jonathan LeVine Gallery by setting up the infrastructure necessary to accept Dash, allowing them to effortlessly send and receive money anywhere in the world.
