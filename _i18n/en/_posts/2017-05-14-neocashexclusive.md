This week I was on a special episode of NeoCash Radio dedicated to the Dash Force.

We talked about Dash in detail (no pun, Amanda), what makes it unique among digital currencies, and how its decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) works. In particular, we covered the Dash Force as the first sub-DAO organization apart from Dash Core, its origins and objectives, and how it fits into the cryptocurrency world of the future.

You can listen to the episode on this blog post here or listen below:
