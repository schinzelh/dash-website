Dash Force would like to announce that we have recently started budgeting for weekly Meetups and Presentations. At this time we will be offering up to 10 total Dash for high quality weekly meetups and presentations. This contest is International and open for all to enter. Please click here for more information about the Dash Force Meetup and Presentation Contest. If you have any questions or would like some examples of best practices from previously successful community members please contact Dash Force News. 


Also, a friendly reminder that there is just under a week left to submit your entries for the Dash Force News YouTube Video Contest. The contest entry deadline is Friday April 28th. We are encouraging people of all languages to enter, not just English. Dash Force member Mark Mason is spearheading this contest so please contact him if you have any questions.


Lastly, donâ€™t forget we still have the Wall Of Coins contest going but you better hurry as there is only 1.3 Dash left to be claimed.
