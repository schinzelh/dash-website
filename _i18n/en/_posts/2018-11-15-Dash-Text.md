Alejandro y Lorenzo showcase the incredible new feature from Dash Text, the purchase command "Compra", which allows people to make quick payments to merchants with just a simple code, without needing to type an amount to be payed or a recipient, its all done seamlessly, users get a confirmation message with the details of the purchase so they can review before actually paying, it works great!
