Dash Force News would like to thank Davis for taking the time to talk and answer our questions.

Davis Dos Santos is an MMA fighter based in Montreal, Canada. Davis is originally from Aracaju Sergipe, Brazil but has been living and training in Montreal for the last 10 years.

I first heard the name Davis Dos Santos about this time last month via the Dash Brazil community. The level of excitement and rumours of Dash sponsoring an MMA fighter were impossible to ignore. After contacting a few prominent members of the Dash Brazil community to confirm the legitimacy of the rumours I was informed that the Dash Brazil community had worked together to organize and crowd fund sponsorship for the then upcoming Davis Dos Santos fight which took place on April 7th.

Since then support from all of Dash’s International communities for Dos Santos has exploded with enthusiasm as Davis delivered a ferociously strong victory. If you missed Dos Santos epic win via knock-out in 34 seconds at TKO 38 on 7th April, you can watch it by [clicking here](https://youtu.be/1BX08FAs_VU). You can witness Davis showcasing the Dash logo branding on his shorts in video link.

Now Dos Santos is back with his next fight scheduled for June 16th at TKO 39 against Peter Grajcar and I’ve been informed that if he wins this next fight he will be given a title match.

Davis Dos Santos is looking for the Dash community to help sponsor him for his next fight on June 16th. Please see the QR code below to Dash address Xc8qG8CQ8FVmsKHn1f9mRaj3CgZ7SLBekc and help donate. I’m led to believe that a Dash proposal will be submitted after this fight for future sponsorship to be funded directly from the Dash DAO. However for this next fight any help the Dash community can give will be greatly appreciated and be a big help towards training camp costs in fight preparation.

Dash Force News offered to pay for a custom blue mouth guard with Dash white text logo which Davis has accepted. You can see mock-up image below of how it will look. We will also be helping to design a new larger Dash logo graphic to be placed on Dos Santos shorts in next fight. The more Dash we can raise the larger the graphic representation will be.

At the end of video interview you hear Davis say “OSS” before writing this article I did not know what this meant or represented. So if you find yourself perplexed by this like myself, fear not and let me enlighten you before you opt to abandon this article for a certain online search engine. Many Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu practitioners use this as a sign of respect. It was introduced and made popular by Grand Master Carlson Gracie.

It is used to demonstrate strong spirit and determination before a fight. It is also used to suggest or confirm a piece of information. For example whenever a Sensei asks or informs of something, the response is “OSS!” It is the response that will signify understanding or confirm understanding.

So now you know and can hold your head high when you impress your friends with your new found knowledge when you watch Dos Santos fight on June the 16th. Every day is a school day.

I want to give a special shout out and thank you to Studioz and MC Protesta from the Dash Brazil community for their help in recording and translating the video.

Could this be the start of a new trend of MMA fighters being sponsored by cryptocurrency?… Just remember Dash was here first.
