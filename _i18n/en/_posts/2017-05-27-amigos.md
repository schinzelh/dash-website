In case you missed our live stream earlier today FEAR NOT! as you can now watch it in full above courtesy of YouTube.

This was the debut episode of The 3 Amigos podcast which as a team intend to do every Friday. If you haven’t subscribed to our YouTube channel yet please do, so you do not miss out on future live episodes. 

We hope you all enjoyed the podcast and welcome any feedback or suggestions you may have for future episodes.

Once again a big thank you to the Dash community for the continued support. We plan to bring you a lot more video content in the near future and grow the channel. So please don’t be a stranger or you’ll miss out on all the fun.
