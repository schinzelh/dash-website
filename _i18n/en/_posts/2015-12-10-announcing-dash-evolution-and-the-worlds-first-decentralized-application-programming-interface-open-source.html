<p>The Dash team is pleased to announce the next phase of the project’s development:</p>
<p><strong>Dash Evolution (Open Source). </strong></p>
<p>The lead developer and creator of Dash, Evan Duffield, states that the goal of Evolution is to “make Dash even more secure, allow it to scale to extremely large levels, and make it easier to use than any cryptographic currency that presently exists.” The key component in this system is the creation of the world’s first decentralized application programming interface (API). Evan will be demonstrating a prototype of this decentralized API at the <strong><a href="http://btcmiami.com" target="_blank">North American Bitcoin Conference in Miami on January 21-22, 2016.</a></strong></p>
<p>Application programming interfaces are how different computer programs and networks talk to each other, and they are a critical part of how people interact with computers. The downside is, as Duffield says, “APIs are centralized by design. All requests to an API are through a centralized service. With Dash Evolution, we’ve designed a new type of API where the process is completely decentralized and still highly secure.” Evolution’s new decentralized API will allow users to interact with the Dash network without downloading and learning a complicated wallet, or waiting for their wallet to sync with the network. The goal of the Dash Evolution project is to make cryptocurrency as easy to use as PayPal and similar services, but without the centralization and fees.</p>
<p>Dash Evolution is a huge project that will take years to fully deploy. The first version will likely be released in 12-18 months and will feature the decentralized API and massive scalability improvements (hundreds of thousands of transactions per second will be possible).</p>
<p>The Dash team is developing Evolution in a completely open way. All documents and plans are open source and available at dash.org/evolution, and suggestions from the community are welcomed.</p>
