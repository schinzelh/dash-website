Neptune Dash went public in January of this year, raising over $CAD 23 mln and is publicly traded on Canada’s TSX-Venture Exchange. The proceeds from the company’s offering were used to buy Dash and set up masternodes. Shareholders in Neptune Dash effectively own a small percentage of the masternodes that Neptune Dash has set up. As masternodes pay their dividends and the price of Dash (hopefully) goes up over the long-term, investors in Neptune Dash should see themselves rewarded either in the form of significant dividends or capital gains.

Not just in Canada

Initially, only Canadian investors could buy shares of Neptune Dash, but as of this month, the company now trades in both the US and EU. In the EU, Neptune Dash trades on the Frankfurt Exchange and in the US, the company trades over-the-counter (OTC). This is the first time US and EU investors have been able to invest directly in Neptune Dash.

In the US, since the offering trades OTC, investors must contact a broker to make the trade for them. Neptune Dash's Troy Wong tells Dash Force News:

> "Neptune Dash is the perfect way for investors to invest in the Dash ecosystem through a regulated and publicly traded company."

Fractional ownership

With the price of a masternode surging from $12,000 in January 2017 to $370,000 today, investors have been clamoring for some way to own a fraction of a masternode and share in the regular masternode payouts. While some services exist to allow people to buy masternode "shares," they require investors to transfer their Dash to the service. This requires a great deal of trust, and many have been clamoring for a "trustless" way to invest in a fractional masternode.

While trustless masternode shares were announced long ago as part of Dash Evolution, they remain on the distant horizon. For those who want to own part of a masternode right now, and do so in a trustless way, Neptune Dash arguably provides the best solution. Now that the company's shares trade in both the US and EU, investors have a new option available to them.
