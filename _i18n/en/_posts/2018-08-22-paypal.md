When a new industry booms, it always has to face the most fundamental challenge of finding a feasible payments system. For the internet in the late 1990s and early 2000s, that method turned out to be PayPal. PayPal is an easy, convenient, secure, and affordable way to pay online.

Don't get me wrong, PayPal is great. But PayPal is still a third-party payments system. All kinds of things can potentially go wrong when you have a third-party handling payment. It doesn't matter how safe and secure they pretend to be.

For example, just a few months ago, in May 2018, a vulnerability in third-party software used by [Mexican banks](https://www.scmagazineuk.com/third-party-software-vulnerability-results-mexican-bank-heist/article/1472689)allowed hackers to steal hundreds of millions of pesos from at least five different banks in Mexico. Attackers routed fiat to fake accounts. They then made numerous cash withdrawals from dozens of bank branches across the country.

Could thieves ever accomplish such a thing if a blockchain payment system like DASH were being used instead?

Definitely not.

Today, there is a new industry searching for an appropriate payment solution.

With more than half of all states in America now recognizing cannabis as a legal, recreational substance for adults, a new marketplace has opened up.

DASH could wind up becoming the [PayPal of the pot industry](https://www.scribd.com/document/365008625/weve-found-the-paypal-of-the-pot-industry-palm-beach-research-group).

Payments using DASH crypto can be integrated into a merchant's mobile app or website in just a few minutes with an easy-to-use, decentralized API. There will be no more relying on third-party payment providers.
