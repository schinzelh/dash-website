This update’s purpose is to share with the community the progress of our PR efforts for 2018 with Wachsman. Below you will find a report that shares the general performance of Wachsman and DCG’s PR efforts. We are sharing the metric based success we have achieved in 2018 along with the links to the majority of media coverage we have earned so far this year. We are excited to share that August 2018 has been our best month for PR so far this year and Q3 is appearing to be our best Quarter ever in earned media.
