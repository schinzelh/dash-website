There have been big leaps in blockchain governance: we've got decentralized [organizations](https://cryptobriefing.com/dao-projects-risk-digix/), smart contract voting, and even a decentralized [state](https://cryptobriefing.com/blockchain-state-decenturion-first-congress/). Now, one cryptocurrency is trying to expand governance options by launching a decentralized venture capital fund. If successful, Dash Ventures will be the first investment fund virtually owned and operated by a DAO. 

The project was described by Dash Core CEO Ryan Taylor this year, but the story was buried in the avalanche of bad market news. In his Q1 [Earnings Call](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=4238&v=5IYyXnk4hZQ), Mr. Taylor announced "a wholly separate entity through which the network can make investments in equity, assets, debt or other investment vehicles with the capability to distribute gains back to the [Masternodes](https://cryptobriefing.com/what-are-masternodes-cryptocurrency/) and strengthen our network."

[Dash Core Group](https://dash.org/), the legal face of the cryptocurrency's development team, claims to be the first entity that is [legally owned](https://www.dashforcenews.com/dash-core-group-becomes-first-legally-dao-owned-entity/) by a DAO.

Masternodes jointly control a treasury funded by 10% of the network's mining rewards. Until now, most of the treasury disbursements have consisted of one-time [grants](https://cryptobriefing.com/dash-science-research-blockchain/) and donations to companies that promise to improve distribution or promotion. A venture fund offers the possibility of collecting dividends. 

The idea was revisited in an AMA last week. "Right now the Dash protocol only allows for gifts,"  Mr. Taylor explained on an episode of the [*Three Amigas*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aA3ioANXsfw&t=123s) podcast.  "What it doesn't work so well for is very high risk ventures...In the real world, people take something in return." For the first time, he said, a new legal entity would make it possible for the DAO to make loans or own equity in the projects it funds. 

It would also have the additional benefit of giving crypto an answer to the Rat Poison and Baby Brains crowd:  "It does away with the argument that it's not backed by anything."

#### Legal Storms Ahead?

But raising a few million dollars for a virtual investment fund is probably the *easy *part. If you thought [Ripple](https://cryptobriefing.com/xrp-is-not-ripple-sec/) was getting a hard time from the [SEC](https://cryptobriefing.com/xrp-is-not-ripple-sec/), imagine the legal hurdles in setting up a company whose owners are international---and anonymous.
