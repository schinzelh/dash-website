Payments cryptocurrency Dash is now listed on London’s CEX.IO cryptocurrency exchange. It can also be bought and sold online with a linked bank account.

CEX is a FinCEN-registered and PCI DSS-compliant exchange and broker that allows users to trade between different currency/fiat pairs and buy and sell digital currencies online with bank transfers or verified bank cards. It has more than one million registered users.

“CEX.IO has a long and respected track record operating in the digital currency space,” Dash Core CEO Ryan Taylor said. “Their team is highly focused on the safety, stability, and legal compliance of its platform. For Dash users and traders, the integration into CEX.IO represents another great option for them to acquire Dash through bank transfers or with payment cards from a significant number of countries.

“The site’s ‘Buy / Sell’ feature makes acquiring Dash as easy as making a typical online purchase. We are especially proud to see Dash added as the latest digital currency on CEX.IO’s platform, as they are very selective about the currencies they choose to add.”

“We see Dash as a top rated digital currency so it was really only a matter of time before we joined forces,” CEX.IO CEO Alex Lutskevych said. “We really respect the fact that Dash is based on a real decentralized ledger and has such a strong core team and growing community. Dash also features a two-tier architecture of PrivateSend, InstantSend, decentralized governance and a budget system.

“It’s obvious that Dash matures fast. Most importantly, Dash’s InstantSend function is incredibly impressive; in my opinion it has already paved the way for and surpassed Bitcoin’s Lightning Network, which will allow for faster Bitcoin transactions to take place. Dash are true standard setters.”
