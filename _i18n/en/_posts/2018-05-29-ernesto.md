Dear Dash Community

I am pleased to announce that [@ErnestoContrerasLatAm](https://www.dash.org/forum/members/26905/) Contreras has joined the Dash Core Group as our new Regional Manager of the Latin America (LATAM) region.

Based out of Mexico City, Mexico, Ernesto's professional and personal life has taken him across both Latin America and Asia. He has 12 years of experience working in fast growing start-ups and corporate conglomerates in the business development and marketing areas, within the consumer good and technology industries.

Ernesto's first working experience was in the consumer goods industry in Venezuela where he worked for Kraft foods and the Colombian headquartered Quala. After receiving an MBA with a solutions marketing concentration from Hult international business school in the Shanghai campus, he moved to Mexico and launched the first Mexican virtual mobile network operator, developing the user base to tens of thousands. He subsequently worked as a marketing manager for Bitso, one of the biggest digital currency exchanges in LatAm, where he communicated crypto currency use cases and benefits beyond the initial niche of users in order to communicate and convert hundreds of thousands of newcomers to this new era of finances.

Please help me welcome Ernesto to the team!

Warm Regards,
