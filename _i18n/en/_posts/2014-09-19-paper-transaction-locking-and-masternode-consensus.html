<p><span style="color: #141414;">This paper introduces a new concept called transaction locking and masternode consensus. This technology will allow for crypto-currencies such as Dash to compete with nearly instantaneous transaction systems such as credit cards for point-of-sale situations while not relying on a centralized authority. If successful, such an idea could revolutionize cryptocurrency, by shortening the delay in confirmation of transactions from as long as an hour (with Bitcoin) to as little as twenty seconds</span><br style="color: #141414;" /><br style="color: #141414;" /><span style="color: #141414;">Full paper can be read at the link below:</span><br style="color: #141414;" /><a class="externalLink" style="color: #176093;" href="https://www.dashpay.io/downloads/InstantTX.pdf" target="_blank">https://www.dashpay.io/downloads/InstantTX.pdf</a></p>
