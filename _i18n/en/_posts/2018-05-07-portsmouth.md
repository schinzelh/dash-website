New Hampshire has become home to an impressive number of cryptocurrency-accepting businesses, with several businesses embracing the decentralized benefits of cryptocurrency by offering common payment options such as Dash, Bitcoin, and Bitcoin Cash.

You can find the hub of this movement in the town of Portsmouth, New Hampshire, which is described as "Bitcoin Village." A significant feature of this village is the Free State Bitcoin Shoppe, a store attracting customers from high-traffic tourist areas nearby with their unique crypto-related and liberty-centric goods. However, tourists quickly learn that they can't purchase anything in the store with cash, which provides an opportunity for the proprietors of the Free State Bitcoin Shoppe to step in and educate newcomers.

The [shop founders](https://www.fsp.org/free-state-bitcoin-shoppe-new-hampshire-cryptoanarchy-mecca/), Derrick J. Freeman and Steven Zeiler, have a mission to "change the money that people use." In a Q&A with the Free State Project, Freeman said that "if customers come in, set up a free wallet on their phone, and leave, I'm happy that they took a step toward greater financial freedom. Success is people using cryptocurrency at stores other than our shop."

Zeiler has also developed a system for local businesses to accept various cryptocurrencies as payment. [AnyPay.global](http://anypay.global/) is a new POS system spreading quickly and flourishing in the Portsmouth area.

"Like most people who use cryptocurrency, Steven and I have long dreamt of a physical retail shop that accepts cryptocurrency exclusively," Freeman noted in the Q&A. "So, in a sense, this idea has been brewing for almost a decade. After years of waiting, we decided that if no one was going to do it, then it would have to be us. After deciding to open a crypto-only shop, the implementation was almost immediate."

Freeman also discussed in the Q&A how the shop helps introduce new users and facilitate sustained use of crypto:

> "In under five minutes, we help them (customers) download a digital wallet on their phone, turn their cash into crypto, and take payment. Everyone leaves feeling good. Most people have long been waiting to try bitcoin, but they've never had someone hold their hand while they do it. Those who don't want to either don't have the time or the interest. That's to be expected. Not everyone wants bitcoin. Some people are perfectly happy with a money that funds wars and loses purchasing power every year."

Freeman and Zeiler have had nearby businesses inquiring how to accept cryptocurrency. The Free State Bitcoin Shoppe provides a [directory](http://freestatebitcoin.com/tour/) that lists a number of merchants accepting cryptocurrencies in the city, even specifying which forms of cryptocurrencies are accepted.

New Hampshire's vibrant cryptocurrency community can be thanked in large part to the Free State Project, a liberty-minded movement of individuals looking to explore and work toward a free society. The movement has led to one of the most cryptocurrency-friendly places in the world, with a high acceptance and use of cryptocurrency among the Free State community of [4,352](https://www.fsp.org/).

The New Hampshire cryptocurrency community played a critical role in the passing of a [state law](https://www.nhliberty.org/bills/view/2017/HB436) that exempts digital currency from the state's money transmission licensing. Even though state regulators showed [opposition](https://www.coindesk.com/regulators-new-hampshires-bitcoin-msb-exemption/), the bill passed due to strong grassroots support. The [crypto supportive](https://cointelegraph.com/news/is-new-hampshire-the-blockchain-capital-of-the-world) policy has attracted startup companies such as LBRY as well as Anypay.

A popular cryptocurrency to highlight within Portsmouth is Dash, which bears support from local businesses. According to [DiscoverDash](https://discoverdash.com/), there are 22 locations in the town accepting Dash. The entire state of New Hampshire has roughly 1.3 million inhabitants and features 54 Dash-accepting businesses, supporting a strong and active Dash-friendly micro-economy.

Joël Valenzuela, editor of [Dash Force News](https://www.dashforcenews.com/cnn-airs-segment-on-dash-but-misses-the-mark/), was recently [featured on CNN](http://truthinmedia.com/cnn-highlights-real-world-digital-currency-use/) illustrating living a cash-free life. Valenzuela is paid in Dash and is able to make nearly all his purchases with Dash, including primary living expenses like bills and rent.

However, CNN appeared unaware that Portsmouth is only the beginning of cryptocurrency adoption and more experiences like Valenzuela's are likely to come about. Unlike local currencies like "Berkshares" and "Equal Dollars" which only hold value within their communities, cryptocurrencies like Dash hold value across the globe.
