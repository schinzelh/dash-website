There’s good news out there for Dash hodlers—you no longer need to be a zillionaire to make money from crypto. Neptune Dash has announced the launch of its first pooled Masternodes, allowing low-budget hodlers to make a small passive income from supporting the blockchain network. 

Masternodes, as Crypto Briefing has already reported, are a second-tier network of high-end servers which facilitate Dash’s InstantSend and PrivateSend transactions. In exchange for their work in upholding the network, masternode owners are given voting rights in the Dash DAO and 45 percent of all block rewards, which are randomly allocated in the same way as mining rewards. 

However, it’s not quite as simple as running a mining rig. In order to prevent mischief in the network, all masternode hodlers must stake at least 1000 DASH in cold storage—making it prohibitively expensive to attack the blockchain, as well as giving them a strong incentive to maintain the coin’s value. At the time of writing, a full masternode costs around $160,000 in addition to equipment costs.
