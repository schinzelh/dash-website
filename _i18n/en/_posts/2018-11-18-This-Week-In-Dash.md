This week has been another fabulous week for Dash with some awesome news developments! Continue reading to get a summary of the week!

Dash Developments of the Week:

Dash Breaks Record with 3 Million Transactions: On November 11th, the Dash network handled over 3 million transactions within a 24 hour period, which broke the previous record of 2.1 million transactions on the Bitcoin Cash network. The stress test validated earlier research conducted by the ASU Blockchain Lab and showed that Dash could easily handle more transactions than the Bitcoin network when it was under its heaviest stress in late 2017. While a couple masternodes and sites went down during the test, overall the network functioned as desired and the median transaction fee during the event remained largely the same at $0.03 USD.

Dash Text Increases Ease of Use with New POS Integration: Dash Text, the Venezuelan platform that allows consumers to send and receive Dash via SMS text, recently integrated a new POS send feature to make it easy for non-smartphone users to send Dash. Now, at the bottom of the merchant’s screen, “Compra XXXXX” will appear allowing the consumer to simply text Dash via a simple number and code rather than a long alphanumeric address. This stands to make Dash more easily available and usable by the over 60% of Venezuelans that do not own smartphones.

Dash 0.13.0 Hits the Testnet with Historic Updates: Dash version 0.13.0 was recently released to the testnet and has an outlined series of testing steps required before full release. The upgrade includes Deterministic Masternode Lists to allow delegation of masternode tasks, Automatic InstantSend to bring near-instant transactions to the wider Dash network for no increase in fees, and upgrades to improve the speed and cost of PrivateSend.

Dash Core Team Q3 2018 Conference Call: Joël broke down his biggest takeaways from the most recent Dash Core Group’s quarterly call. One of the biggest updates was the addition of 0.14.0 between 0.13.0 and 1.0 to integrate long-living masternode quorums (LLMQs) without delaying the release of 0.13.0 due to the scope of its development. Second, the team is still finalizing the process of how usernames for Evolution will be registered. They also discussed how Evolution’s features will be integrated into new and old wallets and the discontinuation of the CoPay wallet unless the community continues the project. Third, due to the discontinuation of the “What’s Going On At Dash” posts, Dash Core Group will release their quarterly slides with additional information. Also, due to the bear market, Dash Core Group has reduced salaries and budget so assets are up to $1.79 million, up from $1.31 million at the end of Q2. Lastly, Dash Ventures is planned to be ready in a month or two, the SEC no-action letter is still in the works, and the new Dash.org website is planned for late November/early December.
