Leading cryptocurrency Dash has partnered with BlockCypher, a leading Blockchain Web Services (BWS) provider, to launch a grant program for startups and established companies seeking blockchain-based solutions in enterprises and new markets.

The program was born from long-standing collaboration between Dash and BlockCypher. It will award blockchain projects that have a viable business model, go-to-market plan, and enable innovative use cases on Dash’s network, in conjunction with BlockCypher’s blockchain infrastructure. According to the official release, the grant program’s funding is available to companies seeking blockchain technology solutions in following categories:

Healthcare
Know Your Customer
Payments
IoT
Insurance
Supply Chain
Telecommunications
Identity
The funding amount will depend on project size and potential.

“The Dash Core Group has a history of providing support for businesses seeking to integrate Dash, but now we can do so in an official, mutually beneficial way. BlockCypher is a wonderful partner for Dash and has been instrumental in attracting new businesses to leverage our network; this program simply extends our support in a structured way to the numerous leads BlockCypher generates for the network,” CEO of Dash Core, Ryan Taylor said.

“With BlockCypher web services and experience, the goal of this program is to seed projects in regions and use cases where blockchain technology has been underdeveloped. This program is teaming up blockchain focused companies to encourage other companies to adopt blockchain technology. It also uniquely has structured phases towards commercialization,” Karen Hsu, Head of Growth at BlockCypher said.

The Dash BlockCypher grant program provides funding for blockchain web services and hosting, consulting, project testing, and integration support. Well established organizations have received grants to demonstrate new ways of using and deploying blockchains. This includes Patientory Foundation, which has a blockchain for more securely and efficiently recording patient data. It is integrating the Dash public blockchain with their private blockchain using BlockCypher’s APIs.

“We are excited to work with Dash and BlockCypher. Using BlockCypher’s web services, we will be the first healthcare blockchain to show interoperability between blockchain networks. This is a major leap forward for how blockchains can be used to process healthcare claims payments,” Chrissa McFarlane, CEO of Patientory said.

Patientory’s enterprise solution and mobile app is scheduled to release by the end of 2017 and will give users the option of one or more blockchains for payment. In combination with Patientory’s permissioned blockchain, patients and payors can use BlockCypher web services to maintain Dash wallets and settle payments over the Dash network.

“Our grant program encourages businesses to commit to blockchain and Dash in particular, because Dash has extremely high scalability potential. The projects we are funding accelerate this commitment and help highlight the advantages of working with Dash compared with other public blockchains,” Taylor said.
