Dear Community members,

It is my pleasure to give you a status report of the Dash Core Team activities. Below, you will find our report covering activities performed through the end of February, grouped by the four strategic areas of focus for 2017.

Software Development
Dash Core - version 12.x (lead developer: UdjinM6)

Preliminary implementation of SPV Methods (blockchain, DGW)
Implementation of InstantSend using Bitcore Libraries (bitcore-p2p-dash)
Dash Evolution Apps (lead developer: Chuck Williams)
New, Old, and Renewed team members have ramped up mind-share with a strong team agreement on Evolution's design vision. Specific work with clear deliverables have been defined in JIRA to include an alpha (prototype) implementation using a team-agreed tech stack for interaction design, demo &amp; review. Finally, a device agnostic "Dash-UI Design System" with example implementation in Vue.JS 2 and Bootstrap 4 is committed and will likely occupy the efforts of all evo team members for several weeks. Initial iterations expected early-mid April.
