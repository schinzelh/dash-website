This week I joined NeoCash Radio in studio for their weekly show.

NeoCash Radio is a weekly podcast focusing on cryptocurrency and finance which has been around for several years, quite a feat in the very new field of digital currency. I joined the show to discuss a variety of topics including Bitcoin’s price and fees, Australian cryptocurrency deregulation, Ethereum’s Mysterium platform, and, of course, Dash and the Dash Force.

You can go to the [blog post on NeoCash Radio’s site](http://neocashradio.com/blog/ep206-life-price-bitcoin-dash-force-news-ethereum-mysterium/), or listen to the podcast below:
