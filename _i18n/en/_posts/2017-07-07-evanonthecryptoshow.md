"On Tonight's episode of "The Crypto Show," we interview the creator of Dash and the head of Dash Labs, Evan Duffield. We discuss the Dash Evolution Roadmap, including improvements to the wallet and some interesting hardware components that Evan envisions being a part of the network. All in all, it's a very interesting show. 
Then we interview Michael, Founder and CSO of Permaclone, a company that makes reusable, sterilizable cloning collars and AeroBlockâ„¢ Filters for the cannabis industry, among other products yet to be announced. He discusses his background in the cannabis industry and the utility of his products, as well as some other interesting tidbits."
