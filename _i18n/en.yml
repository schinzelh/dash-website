    architecture-heading: Next-Gen P2P Network
    architecture-text:
      At Dash’s core is a unique incentivized P2P network.  Miners are rewarded to secure the Dash blockchain and Masternodes are rewarded for validating, storing and serving the Blockchain to end-users.

      Masternodes are a new type of fullnode that can’t be faked and can work together in secure clusters called Quorums to provide new kinds of decentralized services, like instant transactions, anonymization and governance, without the threat of low-cost network attacks.
