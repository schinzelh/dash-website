    hero-text: The purpose of the DASH DAO is to promote, protect and standardize DASH. In the course of our mission, we have received inquiries into how some aspects of DASH are treated under United States law.  The purpose of this document is to address the most common of these inquiries and explain how we believe the laws apply to DASH.  This is not meant as a legal opinion, and you should consult your own attorneys before relying upon it. However, it is meant to state our position on the law, and how the law should be properly interpreted.

    hero-text: |
      The foundation of Dash is its blockchain, which is a decentralized ledger of all transactions that have ever taken place. This blockchain is secured through a consensus mechanism called “Proof of Work” (PoW).

      Through a process called “mining,” people use specialized computers to solve extremely difficult math problems. If their solution is correct, they receive the right to add a new block to the blockchain.

      Once the network verifies that the problem was correctly solved, a new block is added to the blockchain and the miner is rewarded with Dash currency.

    pools-masternode-text: |
      Dash, like Bitcoin and most other cryptocurrencies, is based on a decentralized ledger of all transactions, known as a blockchain. This blockchain is secured through a consensus mechanism; in the case of both Dash and Bitcoin, the consensus mechanism is Proof of Work (PoW). Miners attempt to solve difficult problems with specialized computers, and when they solve the problem, they receive the right to add a new block to the blockchain. If all the other people running the software agree that the problem was solved correctly, the block is added to the blockchain and the miner is rewarded.

    description-text-hero: >
      Governance in a decentralized project is difficult,
      because by definition there are no central authorities to make decisions for the project.
      In Dash, such decisions are made by the network, that is, by the owners of masternodes. The DGBB system allows masternodes
      to vote for or against proposals, which can then be implemented (or not) by Dash's developers. A key example is early in 2016,
      when Dash's Core Team submitted a proposal to the network asking whether the blocksize should be increased to 2 MB. Within 24 hours,
      consensus had been reached to approve this change. Compare this to Bitcoin, where debate on the blocksize has been raging for nearly three years.

    description: >
      The DGBB also provides a means for Dash to fund its own development. While other projects have to depend on donations or premined endowments,
      Dash uses 10% of the block reward to fund its own development. Every time a block is mined, 45% of the reward goes to the miner, 45% goes to a
      masternode, and the remaining 10% is not created until the end of the month. During the month, anybody can make a budget proposal to the network.
      If that proposal is approved by at least 10% of the masternode network, then at the end of the month a series of "superblocks" will be created.
      At that time, the block rewards that were not paid out (10% of each block) will be used to fund approved proposals. The network thus funds itself
      by reserving 10% of the block reward for budget projects.

    marsternode-text: Masternodes are required to have 1000 Dash collateral, a dedicated IP address, and be able to run 24 hours a day without a more than a 1 hr connection loss. Masternodes get paid 45% of the block reward on every block, which is distributed to masternodes one at a time. Typically, around 2 dash is paid to each masternode every 7 days.

    what-heading: WHAT IS MASTERNODE?

    earn-heading: Masternode Income
    earn-text: |
      Masternodes cost money and effort to host so they are paid a share of the block reward to incentivize them. With current masternode numbers and rewards masternodes earn approximately a 11% return on 1000 Dash for the year of 2016. This reward falls off in subsequent years but as the value of Dash is rising and the supply of Dash goes down, masternodes should still be sufficiently incentivized.

      This projection also doesn’t count the fees that masternodes earn whenever someone uses its services (InstantSend and PrivateSend).

    what-hero-heading: What is MasterNode?
    instantiend-text: InstantSend (instant transactions). In contrast, Bitcoin takes about 10 minutes to confirm a payment.
    private-send-text: (anonymous transactions). In contrast, Bitcoin transactions are totally public and traceable. Only the identity of the addresses is anonymous.
    governance-text: (masternodes govern, while the blockchain funds development). In contrast, Bitcoin is controlled by a few big miners and funded by 3rd party centralised institutions with self interests.

      1000 Dash: Arguably the hardest part. Dash can be obtained from exchanges such as Poloniex, Bittrex and Shapeshift‘s service is also an excellent way. For the full list of places to obtain Dash click here.

      A server or a VPS installed with Linux: For the purposes of this guide we will be used Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. We recommend cheap VPSes such as from Vultr and DigitalOcean though any decent provider will do. Generally a low specced one will do. I use the 5 USD ones from Vultr and they work fine.

      A dedicated IP address: These usually come with the VPS/server.

      A little time: When I first got into masternodes, there were only a few guides around and did not cover all the scenarios. It took days for me to figure out the best ways to do everything. However, the process now takes a few minutes. Here are a few guides that I hope will make the process a lot easier.

      If you can’t be bothered with setting up and maintaining your own and don’t mind paying a little extra, you can go with paid masternode hosters which will greatly simplify the process. A few good ones can be found here.

      One of the greatest challenges of building a crypto currency platform is ensuring you create a decentralized system of governance to manage,
      fund, maintain and expand the project. This key element is absent in every currency to date, the natural response is to create a not-for-profit
      foundation that is tasked with maintaining the core protocol and promoting the coin but is not really connected to the coin holders in any meaningful way.
      This approach has a few issues that have been made evident from the experience of older crypto currency platforms.

      to the person doing the work. With this, we could hire core developers and pay them directly after approval of the work in a decentralized fashion.

      In January 2016 we released an early Evolution prototype based on Electrum. Since then, we have been creating reams of documentation and have completely outlined the design goals and begun implementing them.

      The prototype was pretty basic, with user interaction limited to just paying a few friends and user data stored on a dev server, but at least it proved the concept.
      What we set out to do then was to design and prototype all the key technologies that would make these functions work in a purely P2P way, with data secured on the Dash blockchain and accessible from anywhere on any device, with integrated SPV based security and no centralized intermediary services required, and using the most common and censorship resistant protocol available – HTTP(S)

    architecture-heading: Next-Gen P2P Network
    architecture-text:
      At Dash’s core is a unique fully-incentivized peer-to-peer network.  Miners are rewarded for securing the blockchain and masternodes are rewarded for validating, storing and serving the blockchain to users.


      Masternodes represent a new layer of network servers that work in highly secure clusters called quorums to provide a variety of decentralized services, like instant transactions, privacy and governance, while eliminating the threat of low-cost network attacks.

    otc-heading: Over the Counter (OTC)
    otc-text: |
      Buying or selling large amounts of Dash on exchanges can cause price slippage, resulting in the buyer or seller receiving less value than intended. Large buy orders push the price higher, resulting in overpayment. Sizeable sell orders do the opposite, resulting in less value received for the Dash you sell. Fortunately there are “over the counter” or OTC solutions, where a vendor pairs buyers and sellers, allowing them to conduct large transactions off the exchanges and free from slippage.t things like a new website, pr budget, etc. The benefit to you is, you can get many more coins at the current price, then what are available on any exchange. So you can get into a Dash position much easier/cheaper than would otherwise be possible.
