    architecture-heading: Next-Gen P2P Network
    architecture-text:
      At Dash’s core is a unique fully-incentivized peer-to-peer network.  Miners are rewarded for securing the blockchain and masternodes are rewarded for validating, storing and serving the blockchain to users.


      Masternodes represent a new layer of network servers that work in highly secure clusters called quorums to provide a variety of decentralized services, like instant transactions, privacy and governance, while eliminating the threat of low-cost network attacks.

    governance-heading: First Self Governing, Self Funding Protocol

Anything you can do - from marketing to development - that helps Dash grow and improve can be funded.  This means Dash funds its own growth and adoption, consensus is guaranteed, and everyone is accountable to the network.


                     Just submit a treasury proposal and present your idea to the network for funding and make your case, or if you operate a Masternode, be sure to vote!
