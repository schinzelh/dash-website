- name: MyDashWallet

    MyDashWallet is a web interface to the Dash blockchain, inspired by MyEtherWallet and created by DeltaEngine.net. It is explicitly not an online wallet, meaning you maintain control over your private keys at all times. Unlike many other light wallets, MyDashWallet also supports advanced Dash features such as InstantSend and PrivateSend. The project is non-profit, open source and free to use. You can load a wallet and transact in a variety of wallet formats:

    Keystore wallet (file-based)

    Ledger hardware wallet

    Trezor hardware wallet

    Private key
